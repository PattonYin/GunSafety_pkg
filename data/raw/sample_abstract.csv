The tilt sensor is used to measure the target's vertical angle relative to the horizontal reference plane. Digital signal processing circuitry controls the firing of the laser pulse, calculation of time-of-flight range, measurement of the vertical angle of the tilt sensor and storage of tilt sensor and temperature sensor calibration data.

The ballistic ranging information includes the horizontal range to the target. Note, the term “user” is defined to include a person operating the laser ranging device and to include an external targeting device or fire control system for controlling the aiming of a ballistic launcher. Means of providing such ballistic ranging information includes display of the information in an output display and also includes an output electronic data signal.<br />(10) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of one embodiment of the present invention. The block diagram illustrates the interrelations of this embodiment's component parts and is useful in describing how the invention functions. Manufacture of this embodiment of the invention has been accomplished using common, commercially available components. The Opti-Logic Corporation manufactures .[.ome.]. .Iadd.one .Iaddend.embodiment of this invention marketed as the Opti-Logic LH model range finder, a schematic of which is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 5, 5a and 5b</figref>. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a tilt compensated laser ranging device <b>10</b> for determining ranging information for launching a ballistic projectile at a target that is at a different vertical height than the user. The device <b>10</b> of the present embodiment has a housing <b>90</b>, said housing <b>90</b> not shown, that is suitable for handheld operations by virtue of being of small, lightweight and durable construction. For example, the Opti-Logic LH model embodiment has a housing <b>90</b> comprised of shock resistant plastic. The housing <b>90</b> weighs .[.les.]. .Iadd.less .Iaddend.than 11 .[.ounce.]. .Iadd.ounces .Iaddend.and has dimensions of approximately .[.8 in×6 in.×3 in..]. .Iadd.8 inches by 6 inches by 3 inches. .Iaddend.Other component materials could readily be substituted and other choices of dimensions could be readily employed. Other embodiments of the present invention have .Iadd.a .Iaddend.housing suitable .[.other.]. .Iadd.for .Iaddend.portable field operations.[.. Such hous ane.]..Iadd., .Iaddend.suitable for mounting to a tripod or other similar mounting device, or mounting to a ballistic launcher. Contemplated ballistic .[.launcher.]. .Iadd.launchers .Iaddend.include a bow, a crossbow, a rifle, .Iadd.a .Iaddend.shotgun, .Iadd.a .Iaddend.mortar or a grenade launcher.<br />(11) A conventional internal power supply system, not shown, provides voltage for the electronic components of the device <b>10</b>. In this embodiment an internal battery and a high voltage power supply is employed. Other conventional power supply systems could be substituted for the one of this embodiment.<br />(12) To be used to determine ranging information to a selected target, the laser range finder device <b>10</b> must be sighted on the target. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows an aiming system <b>65</b> disposed in the housing <b>90</b>. The .[.of the.]. aiming system of the Opti-Logic LH embodiment comprises a low light reflex sighting system integrally constructed within the housing <b>90</b>. In an alternative embodiment a targeting laser is substituted for the reflex sight. In this alternative embodiment, the laser transmitter <b>20</b> may be employed as both the targeting laser and the ranging laser. Other alternative embodiments employ readily available optical sighting systems, including: an optical reticle, a .[.cross hairs.]. .Iadd.cross-hairs .Iaddend.etched on an optical element, a light emitting diode reticle, a liquid crystal display reticle, a pair of cross hairs, or aiming pin. Still other embodiments employ image magnification systems with the above-identified aiming systems.<br />(13) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2 and 4a</figref>, with the target properly sighted within the aiming system <b>65</b>, the user activates the triggering system <b>80</b> by manipulation of a switch. The triggering system <b>80</b> electronically signals the tilt compensated laser ranging device <b>10</b> to operate through one operating cycle. This electronic signal is herein referred to as the firing signal. The device <b>10</b> sequentially fires a series of laser pulses at the selected target and attempts to detect the reflected returns. The device also sequentially makes multiple measurements of the vertical angle of the target.<br />(14) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a conventional laser transmitter <b>20</b> that is adapted to fire a laser pulse of short duration at a selected target. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2 and 4a</figref>, upon receiving a firing signal, the laser transmitter emits a series of laser pulses for a period of time having a duration between 1 nano-seconds and 60 seconds. The series of laser pulses can be a continuous emission of laser pulses, a staggered emission of laser pulse or even the emission of a single pulse. The laser pulses comprise light energy laser pulses having a pulse repetition rate frequency of between 1 hertz and 20,000 hertz. Pulse repetition rate frequency may be held constant or varied. The laser transmitter may have an optional self-power limitation means to limit the emitted power such that the laser pulses are within a federal eye .[.safe.]. .Iadd.safety .Iaddend.guidelines.<br />(15) The emitted laser pulses are aimed at the surface of a selected target. When the pulses encounter the target, they are, to varying degrees, reflected, absorbed or refracted. The degree to which the pulses are reflected is determined by the amplitude of the reflected laser pulse compared to the amplitude of the transmitted laser pulse. The time-of-flight range, or line-of-sight range, to the selected target is calculated from the measurement of the elapsed time from the firing of a laser pulse to the detection of the corresponding reflected laser pulse.<br />(16) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> which comprises a laser pulse return detector <b>32</b> for detecting the light energy at the pulse repetition rate frequency of the fired laser pulse and for generating a laser pulse return detector signal of an amplitude and duration that corresponds to the amplitude and duration of the detected light energy. The laser pulse return detector signals are electronically routed to the signal-to-noise discrimination system <b>34</b> which electronically discriminates each laser pulse return detector signal The laser pulse return detector signal is classified either as .[.a.]. .Iadd.an .Iaddend.actual reflected pulse return and a corresponding output of the laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> is provided. Otherwise the laser pulse return detector signal is classified by the signal-to-noise discrimination system <b>34</b> as noise or as a false return, and no output of the laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> is provided. In this embodiment, the output of the laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> is a digital timing pulse signal of approximately uniform amplitude that corresponds to the time the corresponding laser pulse return was detected. In alternative embodiments, the laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> simply passes each laser pulse return detector signal classified as an actual reflected pulse return, while blocking all other laser pulse return detector signals.<br />(17) One source of error in calculating the time-of-flight distance to the target is caused when the signal-to-noise discrimination system <b>34</b> classifies a valid laser pulse return of very low amplitude. The corresponding laser pulse return detector signal will reach the gating threshold amplitude preset in signal-to-noise discrimination system <b>34</b> at a later point in the amplitude curve of the laser pulse return detector signal. This results in the signal-to-noise discrimination system <b>34</b> generating a digital timing pulse signal at a later elapsed time. The result is an error in time-of-flight range calculation.<br />(18) The present invention minimizes such error. In <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the automatic gain control system <b>36</b> is shown as controlling the gain of laser pulse return detector <b>32</b>. The design approach taken in the invention is to control the gain of the laser pulse return detector <b>32</b> in a manner that reduces the variance in the amplitudes of said electronic signals from the laser pulse return detector <b>32</b> as compared to the variance in amplitudes of said detected return pulses. The automatic gain control system <b>32</b> of this embodiment of the present invention adjusts the gain of the laser pulse return detector <b>32</b> based on the amplitude of the previously received laser pulse return detector signal. If one pulse is lower than a certain average or threshold amplitude, the gain of the detector is increased. The result is that a majority of the laser is pulse return detector signals passed to the signal-to-noise discrimination system <b>36</b> have amplitudes within a predetermined range for optimal laser pulse return detector signal amplitude.<br />(19) As stated above, the output of the laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> is a digital timing pulse signal. That digital timing pulse signal is received by the laser distance timing system <b>38</b> which measures the elapsed time corresponding to the firing of any one laser pulse and the detection of its reflected return pulse. The laser pulse return detection system <b>30</b> provides the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> a digital data signal corresponding to the elapse time for each detected return pulse. In this embodiment of the invention, the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> comprises at least one microprocessor and a memory for storing instructions and data.<br />(20) The digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> calculates the time-of-flight range to the target corresponding to the elapsed time. To further minimize error in measuring and calculating the time-of-flight range for an operating cycle of the device <b>10</b>, multiple .[.measurement.]. .Iadd.measurements .Iaddend.of the time-of-flight are taken. In this embodiment of the invention, a minimum of eight measurements of elapsed time are made for a series of fired laser pulses. In another embodiment of the invention, a minimum of one measurement of elapsed time is made for a series of fired laser pulses. The digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> calculates the time-of-flight range to the target by using elapsed time data, elapsed time .[.lookup.]. .Iadd.look-up .Iaddend.tables and interpolation algorithms. In another embodiment of the invention, only elapsed time .[.lookup.]. .Iadd.look-up .Iaddend.tables are used. In still another embodiment of the invention, only elapsed time data is used. In this embodiment of the invention, the measured elapsed time data is averaged to determine the time-of-flight range.<br />(21) A novel feature of this invention is to use an internal vertical tilt sensor system <b>40</b> for determining the vertical angle between the target and the reference horizontal of the device housing. The vertical tilt sensor system <b>40</b> is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> as comprising a vertical tilt sensor <b>42</b> and vertical angle signal circuitry <b>44</b> constructed to produce a data signal corresponding the vertical angle to the target. A novel feature of this embodiment of the invention is to use a micro-electronic machine accelerometer <b>41</b>, including a micro-electronic machine silicone accelerometer, as an internal vertical tilt sensor <b>42</b>. These accelerometers <b>41</b> have advantages to other machines, in that they can be used in a normal and in an inverted orientation to allow for either right-handed use or left-handed use by the user. Other embodiments of the invention employ other conventional vertical tilt sensors <b>42</b>, including: an electrolytic liquid level tilt sensor, a optical bubble tilt sensor, a capacitive bubble tilt sensor, pendulum mechanism, rotary optical encoder, rotary electro-resistive encoder, hall effect device or a ceramic capacitive tilt sensor.<br />(22) Another novel feature of this invention is to use the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> to calibrate the vertical tilt sensor <b>42</b> and to store vertical tilt sensor system calibration data. In this embodiment calibration is performed by stepping the accelerometer that comprises the vertical tilt sensor <b>42</b> through a series of discrete predetermined vertical angles, measuring the vertical angle data signals corresponding to said vertical angles and storing the measurement values of said vertical angle data signals corresponding to each predetermined vertical angle in vertical tilt sensor system calibration look-up tables store in the calibration microprocessor <b>52</b> that comprises the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b>, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>. Alternative embodiments of this invention use only a single microprocessor <b>52</b> of any other number, based on manufacturing concerns of cost, performance and availability. Operational measurement of a vertical angle is accomplished by comparing a measurement of vertical angle signal data to vertical tilt sensor system calibration look-up tables and using the high speed digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> to interpolate the actual vertical angle. Other embodiments of the invention do not use interpolation algorithms, but rather use a very large calibration lookup table to determine an individual measurement of the vertical angle.<br />(23) A common source of error in measuring the vertical angle to the target is vibration of the device <b>10</b> housing. This is especially true of this hand held embodiment of the invention. To further minimize error in measuring and calculating the vertical angle for an operating cycle of the device <b>10</b>, multiple measurements of the data signal corresponding the vertical angle to the target are taken. In this embodiment of the invention, a minimum of sight measurements of vertical angle data are made for a series of fired laser pulses. In another embodiment of the invention, a minimum of one measurement of vertical angle data is made for a series of fired laser pulses. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2 and 4b</figref>, the high speed digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> then employs a vibration filtering algorithm to filter out the vibration of the housing. A second algorithm is used to determine the most accurate calculation of vertical angle. Working models of this embodiment have a demonstrated vertical angle accuracy of +/−0.1 degrees.<br />(24) Another common source of error in measuring the vertical angle to the target is variances in the ambient temperature. The device <b>10</b> is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with its environment. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a temperature sensor system <b>70</b> which produces a temperature data signal corresponding to ambient environmental temperature. The digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> stores temperature sensor system calibration data in temperature sensor system calibration data look-up tables. When the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> calculates the vertical angle as previously described, it further calculates the ambient temperature from measured temperature data and stored temperature sensor system calibration data. The digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> then applies temperature corrections to the vertical angle data.<br />(25) An optional embodiment of this invention is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>. An optional embodiment of this invention incorporates a pressure sensor system <b>75</b> to produce a digital data signal corresponding to the ambient atmospheric pressure. Pressure measurement is useful in determining certain ballistic projectile paths. For a marksman to employ a pressure and temperature ballistic aim correction chart in the field to correct the aim point of a rifle firing a bullet, it is useful to have convenient pressure and temperature measurement readout.<br />(26) Still another common source of error can be minimized by a novel feature of the triggering system <b>80</b> of the device <b>10</b>. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2 and 4a</figref>, the triggering system <b>80</b> of this embodiment of the invention comprises a user manipulated, release-to-return, spring loaded triggering switch or button. The trigger button has two positions. The up position is the release position. The down position is the standby position. The user must press and hold the button in the down for a period of time. The triggering system signals the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> to send a standby signal to the device components. While the user holds the trigger button in the standby position, the device is prevented from sending a firing signal to the laser transmitter and a standby voltage is applied to the device components. When the user releases the trigger button, the button springs to the up position and the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> to send a firing signal to the device components .[.device components.]. and causes a firing voltage to be applied to the laser transmitter. This release to fire feature minimizes the vibration caused by handheld operations. The result is more accurate readings with less user proficiency. Additionally, allowing the button to remain in the release position for period of time selectable between 1 second and 60 seconds causes low power voltage to be applied to the device components. This is a power conservation feature of the invention.<br />(27) Each of these systems of the device are controlled by the digital processing circuit <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>. The digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> of this embodiment is comprised of microprocessors <b>52</b> and associated memory for storing instruction and data. In an alternative embodiment, the digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> is comprised of a logic circuit having a memory means. Besides calculation of horizontal range, digital signal processing circuit <b>50</b> of this embodiment is adapted to calculate the height of a target from a time-of-flight range, a vertical angle to the top of the target and a vertical angle to the bottom of the target.<br />(28) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2 and 4c</figref>, the device <b>10</b> has an output signal system <b>60</b> which can selectively produce various data signal corresponding to the output parameter selected and according to the mode of operation of the device <b>10</b>. In horizontal range mode, the output corresponds to the horizontal range to the target. Other selections for digital output include: the vertical angle to the target, the time of flight range to the target, ambient pressure and ambient temperature. According to this embodiment of the invention, a user readable output display system receives the data signal corresponding to the output parameter selected and displays the selected output data for the user. According to alternative embodiments, the data signal corresponding to the output parameter selected is provided as data signal input to an aiming system controlling the associated ballistic launcher.<br />(29) The Opti-Logic XT embodiment of this invention utilizes the trigger button to select between the various modes of operation and output display. The device has an output signal system which can selectively produce various data signal corresponding to the output .[.perimeter.]. .Iadd.parameter .Iaddend.selected and according to the mode of operation of the device. In horizontal range mode, the output corresponds to the horizontal range to the target. Other selections for digital output would be the vertical angle to the target, the .[.time of flight.]. .Iadd.time-of-flight .Iaddend.range, or otherwise known as the .[.line of sight.]. .Iadd.line-of-sight .Iaddend.range to the target, and the pressure and temperature can selectively be displayed as well, according to this embodiment of the invention.<br />(30) Thus, although there have been described particular embodiments of the present invention of a new and useful device for Tilt Compensated Laser Range Finder, it is not intended that such references be construed as limitations upon the scope of this invention except as set forth in the following claims."

The intention, however, is not to limit the disclosure to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the disclosure is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives thereof.<br />DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br />[0018] Firearms in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure may provide a user with information regarding the state of the firearm, thereby enhancing the user's experience with the firearm. Such information may include measurement data, such as round counting and other statistical information regarding use of the firearm. In some embodiments, such information may be displayed without affecting the grip of the firearm.<br />[0019] Firearms in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure may integrally and internally carry electronic components that facilitate providing the user with information regarding the state of the firearm. Firearms in accordance with some embodiments of the present disclosure may integrally and internally carry auxiliary devices that are typically provided as “add-on” or accessory devices, such as laser sights, lights, and cameras. In some embodiments, incorporating such devices into a firearm provides various advantages, such as providing a more robust design, and reducing the size of a device that would otherwise be an accessory to a firearm. As a result, this may reduce issues associated with installation and maintenance of accessory devices. In addition, by integrating electronic components into the firearm, the user may seamlessly adapt to using the firearm rather than having an intrusive add-on accessory, which may be cumbersome for the user and for manufacturing. Further still, integrated electronic components may also facilitate fitting a firearm into a carrying device, such as a holster.<br />[0020] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> illustrate a firearm <b>10</b>, more specifically, a handgun, in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. Generally, the firearm <b>10</b> includes a frame <b>12</b> that couples to a barrel portion <b>14</b>. The barrel portion <b>14</b> is adapted to discharge ammunition from a muzzle opening <b>16</b>. The frame <b>12</b> includes a grip <b>18</b> that is grasped by the hand of firearm user. The grip <b>18</b> defines a magazine chamber <b>20</b>, which may open at the bottom of the firearm <b>10</b>, that detachably receives a magazine <b>22</b> carrying cartridges, or “rounds”, of ammunition. In some embodiments, the firearm <b>10</b> is a blowback firearm or a recoil operation firearm (that is, the firearm <b>10</b> includes a slide <b>53</b> that moves backward relative to the frame <b>12</b> when the firearm <b>10</b> discharges ammunition). As described in further detail below, the firearm <b>10</b> further includes electronic components that facilitate providing the firearm user with information regarding the firearm <b>10</b>, such as, for example, the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b> carried by the firearm <b>10</b>.<br />[0021] Still referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and with additional reference to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>, the frame <b>12</b> of the handgun an electronics assembly <b>28</b> that facilitates providing the firearm user with information regarding the firearm <b>10</b>. The electronics assembly <b>28</b> includes one or more sensors (for example, three sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> are depicted in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>) that are carried in the grip <b>18</b>. The sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> are adapted to sense a state of the magazine <b>22</b> corresponding to a number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>, and the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> send signals that correspond to the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. With additional reference to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref>, the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> may sense the state of the magazine <b>22</b> by sensing the position of the spring-biased ammunition ejection plate <b>36</b>, or “follower,” in the magazine <b>22</b>. For a magazine <b>22</b> having a cartridge capacity N, the follower <b>36</b> occupies N+1 positions within the magazine <b>22</b> as the cartridges are ejected from the magazine <b>22</b>. Similarly, when N cartridges remain in the magazine <b>22</b>, the follower is disposed at the N+1 position within the magazine (for example, when zero cartridges remain in the magazine <b>22</b>, the follower <b>36</b> is at a first position in the magazine <b>22</b>, when one cartridge remains in the magazine <b>22</b>, the follower <b>36</b> is at a second position in the magazine <b>22</b>, and so forth). Thus, when the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> send signals to indicate that the follower <b>36</b> is disposed at the N+1 position, the signals also indicate that N cartridges remain in the magazine <b>22</b>.<br />[0022] In some embodiments, the number of sensors is equal to the number of positions that are occupied by the follower <b>36</b> within the magazine <b>22</b> (that is, N+1). In some embodiments, the number of sensors is less than the number of positions that are occupied by the follower <b>36</b> within the magazine <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the number of sensors is greater than the number of positions that are occupied by the follower <b>36</b> within the magazine <b>22</b>.<br />[0023] In some embodiments, the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> may be Hall effect sensors that sense the magnetic field produced by a magnet <b>38</b> carried by the follower <b>36</b> of the magazine <b>22</b>. The magnet <b>38</b> may be a rare earth metal, and the magnet <b>38</b> may be carried in a pocket formed on the follower <b>36</b>, adhered to a surface of the follower <b>36</b>, and/or the like. In some embodiments and as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the grip <b>18</b> carries three Hall effect sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b>, and one sensor <b>34</b> is positioned near the opening of the magazine chamber <b>20</b>, one sensor <b>30</b> is positioned near the top of the magazine chamber <b>20</b>, and one sensor <b>32</b> is positioned at an intermediate position between the other sensors <b>30</b> and <b>34</b>. Each sensor <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> sends a signal that is proportional to the sensed force produced the magnetic field of the magnet <b>38</b>, which is based on the position of the magnet <b>38</b> and the follower <b>36</b> within the magazine <b>22</b>. As such, the signals change as the magnet <b>38</b> and the follower <b>36</b> are displaced within the magazine <b>22</b> to eject cartridges of ammunition into the barrel portion <b>14</b> of the firearm <b>10</b>. As a result, the signals may be considered together to determine the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. Stated another way, the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> may “triangulate” the position of the magnet <b>38</b> and the follower <b>36</b>, and thereby the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b> may be determined. In other embodiments, the grip <b>18</b> carries a single Hall effect sensor <b>34</b> near the opening of the magazine chamber <b>20</b>. The sensor <b>34</b> sends a signal that is proportional to the sensed force produced the magnetic field of the magnet <b>38</b>, which is based on the position of the magnet <b>38</b> and the follower <b>36</b> within the magazine <b>22</b>. As such, the signal changes as the magnet <b>38</b> and the follower <b>36</b> are displaced within the magazine <b>22</b> to eject cartridges of ammunition into the barrel portion <b>14</b> of the firearm <b>10</b>. As a result, the signals correspond to and may be used to determine the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>.<br />[0024] In other embodiments, the sensors are a plurality of Reed switches that sense the magnetic field produced by the magnet <b>38</b> carried by the follower <b>36</b> of the magazine <b>22</b>. The number of Reed switches may be equal to the number of cartridges of ammunition initially carried by the magazine, and movement of the follower <b>36</b> and the magnet <b>38</b> may actuate a different Reed switch each time a cartridge of ammunition is ejected from the magazine <b>22</b>. As a result, the Reed switches together sense the relative position of the follower <b>36</b> and send signals that together correspond to the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>.<br />[0025] In other embodiments, the sensors may be proximity sensors or optical sensors.<br />[0026] The sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> are operatively coupled to and send the signals corresponding to the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b> to a controller <b>40</b>, which may include a microprocessor. The controller <b>40</b> may be carried in the frame <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the controller <b>40</b> determines the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b> based on the signals received from the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> and by compensating for the changing density of the spring <b>41</b> in the magazine <b>22</b>. That is, as cartridges of ammunition are ejected from the magazine <b>22</b> and the spring <b>41</b> unloads, the reduced metal density causes less interference between the magnet <b>38</b> and the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b>. The controller <b>40</b> may be configured to consider the signals received from the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> in view of this effect, and thereby compensate for this effect. In some embodiments, the controller <b>40</b> may be calibrated, for example, when a magazine <b>22</b> is coupled to the firearm <b>10</b>, and thereby compensate for other factors that could affect the degree of interference between the magnet <b>38</b> and the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b>, such as using magazines <b>22</b> formed of different materials and/or having different wall thicknesses, using magazines <b>22</b> carrying different types of cartridges, and the like.<br />[0027] In some embodiments and referring specifically to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>40</b> may be carried in the frame <b>12</b> near the muzzle opening <b>16</b>, and the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> may be operatively coupled to the controller <b>40</b> via a flexible circuit <b>42</b> that extends from the grip <b>18</b>, through the trigger guard <b>26</b>, and toward the muzzle opening <b>16</b>. The flexible circuit <b>42</b> may be disposed between a base portion <b>44</b> of the trigger guard <b>26</b> and a cover portion <b>46</b> of the trigger guard <b>26</b>. In some embodiments and still referring specifically to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the controller <b>40</b> may be carried in the grip <b>18</b> of the frame <b>12</b>, and the controller <b>40</b> may be operatively coupled to one or more components of the electronics assembly <b>28</b> carried in the frame <b>12</b> near the muzzle opening <b>16</b> (for example and as described in further detail below, a laser gun sight <b>68</b>, an illuminating device <b>70</b>, and/or a camera <b>72</b>) via the flexible circuit <b>42</b>. In any case, any of the remaining components of the electronics assembly <b>28</b> may be operatively coupled via the flexible circuit <b>42</b>.<br />[0028] In some embodiments, a flat ribbon cable (not shown) may be used instead of a flexible circuit to couple two or more of the components of the electronics assembly in any of the manners described herein.<br />[0029] The electronics assembly <b>28</b> may include a power supply <b>48</b> carried by the frame <b>12</b>. In some embodiments and referring specifically to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the power supply <b>48</b> may be carried in a cavity <b>50</b> of the frame <b>12</b> and normally obscured by a detachable front cover <b>52</b>. The power supply <b>48</b> may be detachably carried in the frame <b>12</b> or non-detachably carried in the frame <b>12</b>. The power supply <b>48</b> may be a rechargeable, non-rechargeable battery, or the like. The other components of the electronics supply may receive power from the power supply <b>48</b> via the controller <b>40</b>.<br />[0030] Turning now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 3, 5A, 5B, and 5C</figref>, the controller <b>40</b> is operatively coupled to and sends the signals corresponding to the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b> to a display. The display visually presents the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. The display may be disposed at various locations on the firearm. For example and referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the display may be disposed on the rear surface <b>51</b> of the grip <b>18</b> adjacent to the slide <b>53</b>.<br />[0031] The display may take various forms. For example and referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5A</figref>, a display <b>54</b>A may include a plurality of illuminating devices <b>56</b> (for example, light-emitting diodes (LEDs)). In some embodiments and as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5A</figref>, the plurality of illuminating devices <b>56</b> may be disposed in a horizontal array (that is, a row). In other embodiments, the plurality of illuminating devices <b>56</b> may be disposed in a vertical array (that is, a column).<br />[0032] In some embodiments, the controller may energize a number of illumination devices <b>56</b> corresponding to the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. In some embodiments, the controller also changes the color of the illumination devices <b>56</b> based on number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. For example, the illumination devices <b>56</b> may emit green light when the magazine is relatively full (for example, having at least two thirds of its initial capacity), yellow light when the magazine is less full (for example, having at least one third and less than two thirds of its initial capacity), and red light when the magazine is relatively low (for example, having less than one third of its initial capacity). In some embodiments, the controller may energize a number of illuminating devices <b>56</b> based on a non-linear relationship with the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. For example, the controller may de-energize one illumination device <b>56</b> when one third of the cartridges of ammunition in the magazine <b>22</b> have been discharged, de-energize another illumination device <b>56</b> when another third of the cartridges of ammunition in the magazine <b>22</b> have been discharged, and then de-energize a single illumination device <b>56</b> when each of the remaining cartridges of ammunition in the magazine <b>22</b> have been discharged.<br />[0033] In some embodiments, the plurality of illuminating devices <b>56</b> are relatively light-weight and relatively small such that the presence of the display <b>54</b>A does not significantly affect the mechanics of the firearm <b>10</b>. In some embodiments, the plurality of illuminating devices <b>56</b> emit a relatively small amount of light compared to other types of displays (for example, liquid crystal display screens), which may be beneficial in dark and/or dangerous situations. In some embodiments, the plurality of illuminating devices <b>56</b> provides a relatively small and/or low power display compared to other types of displays (for example, liquid crystal display screens).<br />[0034] As another example, a display may be a screen (for example, a liquid crystal display screen) that presents characters (that is, numbers <b>58</b> and/or letters <b>60</b>; see, for example, the display <b>54</b>B of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5B</figref>) or symbols <b>62</b> (for example, shapes having the general appearance of cartridges of ammunition; see, for example, the display <b>54</b>C of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5C</figref>) corresponding to the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. In some embodiments and as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 5B and 5C</figref>, the characters (in the case of the display <b>54</b>B of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5B</figref>) or symbols <b>62</b> (in the case of the display <b>54</b>C of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5C</figref>) may also provide information regarding the initial capacity of the magazine <b>22</b>. In other embodiments, the characters (in the case of the display <b>54</b>B of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5B</figref>) or symbols <b>62</b> (in the case of the display <b>54</b>C of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5C</figref>) may only provide information regarding the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>. The display may provide information in color, grayscale, or black and white. The display may be carried at various locations of the frame <b>12</b>. For example, the display may be carried at the rear of the frame <b>12</b>.<br />[0035] In some embodiments, the firearm <b>10</b> may additionally provide an auditory warning (for example, via an alarm <b>64</b>) and/or a haptic warning (for example, vibrating the firearm <b>10</b> by energizing a motor <b>66</b> having an eccentrically weighted shaft) based on the number of rounds remaining the magazine <b>22</b>. For example, the firearm <b>10</b> may provide an auditory warning and/or a haptic warning if the magazine <b>22</b> has a “low” amount of ammunition remaining (for example, less than three rounds) or if the magazine <b>22</b> is empty. The alarm <b>64</b> and the motor <b>66</b> may be operatively coupled to the controller <b>40</b> and may receive power from the power supply <b>48</b> via the controller <b>40</b>.<br />[0036] In some embodiments, the firearm <b>10</b> (more specifically, the controller <b>40</b> and, even more specifically, the display) does not require user programming and lacks components that facilitate user programming (for example, a user interface having inputs, such as a keyboard). In some embodiments, the firearm <b>10</b> automatically determines and displays the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in the magazine <b>22</b>.<br />[0037] Referring again to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the controller <b>40</b> may be operatively coupled to and control one or more auxiliary devices, such as a laser gun sight <b>68</b> (for example, a green laser gun sight), an illuminating device <b>70</b> (for example, a light emitting diode), a camera <b>72</b> (for example, capable of capturing photo and/or video images), and/or a motion sensor <b>74</b> (which may be used, for example, as a training aid by monitoring steadiness of the firearm <b>10</b> prior pulling the trigger <b>24</b>). The laser gun sight <b>68</b>, the illuminating device <b>70</b>, the camera <b>72</b>, and/or the motion sensor <b>74</b> may be integrally and internally carried in the frame <b>12</b>. The laser gun sight <b>68</b>, the illuminating device <b>70</b>, the camera <b>72</b>, and/or the motion sensor <b>74</b> may be disposed at the front of the frame <b>12</b> proximate the muzzle opening <b>16</b> (see <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>; the camera <b>72</b> is not shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>) to facilitate sighting, illuminating, and/or capturing images of a target. The laser gun sight <b>68</b>, the illuminating device <b>70</b>, the camera <b>72</b>, and/or the motion sensor <b>74</b> may be exposed through openings in the front cover <b>52</b>. In some embodiments, the laser gun sight <b>68</b> and/or the illuminating device <b>70</b> may be disposed at the top of the grip <b>18</b> to provide space in the front of the barrel portion <b>14</b> for the other auxiliary devices and to facilitate fitting the firearm <b>10</b> in storage or transport devices. The laser gun sight <b>68</b>, the illuminating device <b>70</b>, the camera <b>72</b>, and/or the motion sensor <b>74</b> may receive power from the power supply <b>48</b> via the controller <b>40</b>.<br />[0038] The controller <b>40</b> may activate any of the components of the electronics assembly <b>28</b>, such as, for example, the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b>, the display, the laser gun sight <b>68</b>, the illuminating device <b>70</b>, the camera <b>72</b>, and/or the motion sensor <b>74</b> (simultaneously, according to a predetermined sequence, or according to a user-specified sequence) upon receiving a signal from an activation sensor <b>76</b>. In some embodiments and as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the activation sensor <b>76</b> may be pressure switch, or pressure “pad”, carried on the grip <b>18</b> below the trigger guard <b>26</b>. In other embodiments, the activation sensor <b>76</b> may be pressure switch carried on a side surface of the grip <b>18</b>. In any case, the sensor <b>76</b> may actuated, and the auxiliary devices are activated, when the firearm <b>10</b> is grasped by the grip <b>18</b>. In other embodiments, the activation sensor <b>76</b> may sense when the firearm <b>10</b> has been removed from a firearm storage device (not shown), such as a holster. More specifically, the sensor <b>76</b> may be a Hall effect sensor or a Reed switch that senses the magnetic field produced by a magnet carried by the firearm storage device. The sensor <b>76</b> is actuated, and the auxiliary devices are activated, when the firearm <b>10</b> is removed from the firearm storage device and the sensor <b>76</b> does not sense the magnetic field produced by the magnet. In other embodiments, the sensor <b>76</b> may be a motion and/or position sensor (for example, an accelerometer) that senses when the firearm <b>10</b> is in a “holstered,” or “vertical,” position, when the firearm <b>10</b> is in a use, or “horizontal,” position, or when the firearm <b>10</b> moves from a vertical position to a horizontal position. As such, the sensor <b>76</b> is actuated, and the auxiliary devices are activated, when the firearm <b>10</b> is in the horizontal position, or when the firearm <b>10</b> moves from the vertical position to the horizontal position. In some embodiments, the controller <b>40</b> may activate the laser gun sight <b>68</b>, the illuminating device <b>70</b>, the camera <b>72</b>, and/or the motion sensor <b>74</b> upon receiving one or more signals from one or more other inputs, such as one or more actuatable buttons carried by the frame <b>12</b>. In these embodiments, each input may be actuated to activate one of the auxiliary devices.<br />[0039] In some embodiments, the electronics assembly <b>28</b> does not control, and/or are electronically uncoupled from, the firing components of the firearm <b>10</b> (that is, the trigger <b>24</b>, etc.).<br />[0040] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate a firearm <b>110</b>, more specifically, a handgun, in accordance with another embodiment of the present disclosure. Generally, the firearm <b>110</b> includes the same components and features as the firearm <b>10</b>, except that the firearm <b>110</b> includes a grip <b>112</b> having a selectively detachable rear portion <b>114</b>. The detachable portion <b>114</b> may couple to the remainder of the grip <b>112</b> via, for example, fasteners (not shown), pins (not shown), or the like. The detachable portion <b>114</b> carries, in part, an electronics assembly <b>116</b>, which may be generally similar to the electronics assembly <b>28</b> described above. The electronics assembly <b>116</b> includes a controller <b>118</b>, such as the controller <b>40</b> described above, that is imbedded within or carried on an inner surface of the detachable portion <b>114</b> of the grip <b>112</b>. The electronics assembly <b>116</b> also includes one or more sensors <b>120</b>, such as the sensors <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and <b>34</b> described above, that are imbedded within or carried on an inner surface of the detachable portion <b>114</b> of the grip <b>112</b>. The electronics assembly <b>116</b> further includes a light pipe <b>122</b> that couples to the controller <b>118</b> and the sensors <b>120</b>. The light pipe <b>122</b> is exposed near the top of the rear surface of the grip <b>112</b> and acts as a display. That is, the light pipe <b>122</b> visually presents the number of cartridges of ammunition remaining in a magazine carried by the firearm <b>110</b>. The light pipe <b>122</b> may visually present the remaining number of cartridges of ammunition in various manners, including, for example, by transmitting light from a plurality of illuminating devices, such as LEDs (and thereby having an external appearance similar to the display <b>54</b>A described above). As another example, the light pipe <b>122</b> may visually present the remaining number of cartridges of ammunition by having an external appearance similar to the display <b>54</b>B or the display <b>54</b>C described above. The electronics assembly <b>116</b> further includes an input, illustratively an actuatable button <b>124</b>, that is carried by the detachable portion <b>114</b> of the grip <b>112</b>. The button <b>124</b> may be actuated to activate the light pipe <b>122</b>, a laser gun sight, such as the laser gun sight <b>68</b> described above, an illuminating device, such as the illuminating device <b>70</b> described above, a camera, such as the camera <b>72</b> described above, and/or a motion sensor, such as the motion sensor <b>74</b> described above.<br />[0041] Various modifications and additions can be made to the exemplary embodiments discussed. For example, while the embodiments described above refer to particular features, this disclosure also contemplates embodiments having different combinations of features and embodiments that do not include all of the described features. Accordingly, the scope of the disclosure is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the scope of the disclosure, together with all equivalents thereof."
US-20150241176-A1,"In a method for visually adaptively camouflaging objects, the background and/or the surroundings in front of which and/or in which the object is situated are/is detected by means of a camera or a sensor array. The background and/or the surroundings thus detected are/is reproduced as an image (3) in a device for camouflaging the object.","[0012] The invention will now be explained in more detail by referring to the accompanying figures and to exemplified embodiments.<br />[0013] In the drawings:<br />[0014] FIG. 1 shows an object which is to be adaptively visually camouflaged in a terrain, and<br />[0015] FIG. 2 schematically shows the visually adaptively camouflaging of the object of FIG. 1 by taking into account of the terrain according to the present invention.<br />[0016] FIG. 1 shows a parking area with, among others, a parked car 1, which is to capture at least visually in order to camouflage any military objects in this area. The camouflage is to take place by a panel 3, for example, on which LED array 4 proposed in accordance with the present invention extends in strips both in X- and in Y-direction 5 on the panel 3. Besides a military vehicle 1 to be camouflaged in the parking area 2, for example, further possible objects are present, such as other vehicles as well as houses in the background and terrain 9, which must be captured according to the present invention in order to be used as camouflage for the object 1.<br />[0017] FIG. 2 schematically shows the camouflage pattern 3 taking into account the parking area 2 to camouflage the object 1 in the parking area surrounding, which camouflage pattern is displayed on an LED panel. By the visual capturing of the parking area 2 and the objects 9, for example by means of cameras or another suitable sensor optic, they are visually depicted on the panel 3 with the LED-arrays 4. By the panel 3, the vehicle 1 can be camouflaged effectively.<br />[0018] First, an image is captured by a camera and read to the central computer for further processing.<br />[0019] In a first step, the image is calibrated in relation to intensity and color by look-up table or by modulation transfer function. Thereafter, the image is divided into blocks, which were randomized, as can be seen in FIG. 2. As the sky is usually disturbing, pixels, which can be assigned to the sky, will be replaced by average pixels from the background. The image is then transformed to the dimension of the corresponding LED arrays.<br />[0020] Thus, the exemplified vehicle 1 can efficiently be camouflaged in an urban environment, for example, by means of a panel 3 placed in front of the vehicle 1, by at least transferring the intensity and color of the environment to the object.<br />[0021] According to one embodiment, an LED grid is used having at least 3 cm to 10 cm distance in X- and Y-directions. As LED type, a multi-chip RGB (red-green-blue) is used, for example. The output is about 70 W/m.sup.2.<br />[0022] The RGB LED strips must each be serially controlled. The image data, which can be pushed through the strips, are only displayed when the desired LED-position is reached. This must be done, for example, by a corresponding bus command.<br />[0023] The RGB LEDs are dimmable, for example, (8 bit, PWM) and the LED grid and the brightness correspond to the minimum requirement of 100 mm grid and about 70 W/m.sup.2 per square meter.<br />[0024] The panel 3 with the LED array 4 is combined, in its function, with an IR-adaptive camouflage, as mentioned above and as already known from WO 2011/000679. The LED array is constructed such that individual LED strips having a width of about 1 cm are attached on an air-permeable fabric. The distance between the single lines is 3 cm to 10 cm. By having a sufficient distance between the lines, the air can still flow through the fabric. Thus, the functions of IR adaptive panels and LED strips can be combined to a system of IR-vis-adaptive camouflage system.<br />[0025] The camouflaging of objects schematically described in relation to FIG. 1 or 2 is only an example, which can be amended or changed in any way and manner of course, or which can be extended or completed by further objects being represented. Thus, also further objects, as phone booths, street lamps, waste containers, etc., can be visually captured in addition to the mentioned objects in order to be displayed on the panel with the aid of the LED-array. Furthermore, it is of course not mandatory to use a two-dimensional panel or fabric with the LED array, as described in connection with FIG. 2, but the camouflage arrangement can also be three-dimensional in correspondence with a three-dimensional object to be camouflaged. In the case of vehicle, the camouflage can be designed in a shell-like manner, adapted for the camouflage of a front or a rear part, for the camouflage of a side part or for the camouflage of the roof. It makes sense to offer basic shapes for the camouflage, which can be used to camouflage an object.<br />[0026] It is essential that the object to be camouflaged does not lift from the environment and, on the other hand, the panel used for camouflage is visually well adapted to the environment."

and a handle member 300 coupled to the rear portion of the rotary member 100 in such a manner as to be adjusted in length in a telescoping manner, whereby the slant portion and the parallel portion formed on the internal peripheral surface of the cartridge chamber are all cleaned at the same time.<br />[0034] In this case, the cleaning apparatus according to the present invention is applicable to the cartridge chamber of the artillery in a range between 76 mm and 108 mm, and as shown in FIG. 3, the cartridge chamber is designed to have the same diameter from the inlet to a given distance and to be tapered after the given distance.<br />[0035] Hereinafter, an explanation on each member according to the present invention will be given.<br />[0036] The rotary member 100 is made of a metal material having excellent strength and hardness and has a body 110 having a generally circular section and a hollow interior, the power supply part 120 adapted to supply power to the respective members by receiving the power from the interior of the body 110, and the motor 130 mounted at the front side of the body 110 in such a manner as to be rotated by receiving the power from the power supply part 120.<br />[0037] In this case, the body 110 has wheels 140 mounted on the outer periphery thereof in such a manner as to be moved forwardly and backwardly in the cartridge chamber.<br />[0038] Further, the power supply part 120 may be formed of batteries, but so as to supply large power, it is connected by means of an electric wire (not shown) to the outside in such a manner as to receive power thereto.<br />[0039] The cleaning member 200 has the rotary body 210 operated cooperatively with the rotation of the motor 130, the slant cleaning parts 220 coupled slantly to the front portion of the outer periphery of the rotary body 210, and the parallel cleaning parts 230 coupled to the rear portion of the outer periphery of the rotary body 210 in such a manner as to have both ends parallel with each other.<br />[0040] Accordingly, the slant cleaning parts 220 and the parallel cleaning parts 230 are mounted plurally along the outer periphery of the rotary body 210.<br />[0041] In this case, the rotary body 210 is rotatably coupled to the motor 130 in such a manner as to be operated cooperatively with the rotation of the motor 130, and the rotary body 210 is coupled to a slant case 222 of each slant cleaning part 220 as will be discussed later and to a parallel case 232 of each parallel cleaning part 230 as will be discussed later.<br />[0042] The slant cleaning parts 220 and the parallel cleaning parts 230 are rotated at the same time by means of the rotary body 210. Accordingly, they may be formed of a single member on which a slant portion and a parallel portion are divided. Alternatively, they may be independently separated from each other.<br />[0043] The range to the slant portion after a given distance from the inlet of the cartridge chamber of the artillery is cleaned by means of the slant cleaning parts 220, thereby preventing the muzzle from being malfunctioned due to the foreign materials existing inside the cartridge chamber thereof.<br />[0044] Desirably, each slant cleaning part 220 includes the slant case 222 coupled slantly to the rotary body 210, slant springs 224 mounted inside the slant case 222, and slant brushes 226 coupled in compressed and released manners to the slant springs 224.<br />[0045] Desirably, each parallel cleaning part 230 includes the parallel case 232 coupled in parallel to the rotary body 210, parallel springs 234 mounted inside the parallel case 232, and parallel brushes 236 coupled in compressed and released manners to the parallel springs 234.<br />[0046] As the cartridge chamber has different inner diameters, the slant brushes 226 and the parallel brushes 236 are rotated in the state where the slant springs 224 and the parallel springs 234 are compressed by the different inner diameters, thereby cleaning the interior of the cartridge chamber.<br />[0047] Further, the slant brushes 226 and the parallel brushes 236 are detachably coupled to the slant case 222 and the parallel case 232, so that if they are worn out, they can be can be exchanged with new ones.<br />[0048] Also, the slant brushes 226 and the parallel brushes 236 have a separation cap 270 mounted on the undersides thereof, so that they can be detachably mounted on the slant case 222 and the parallel case 232. That is, the slant case 222 and the parallel case 232 have a groove formed on the inner periphery thereof, into which the separation cap 270 is fittingly inserted, so that the slant brushes 226 and the parallel brushes 236 can be detachably mounted on the slant case 222 and the parallel case 232.<br />[0049] More desirably, a stopper 240 is further disposed between the slant case 222 and the parallel case 232 and has a rotary roller 242 mounted thereon, thereby being rotated in the cartridge chamber by means of the rotation of the rotary body 210.<br />[0050] The stopper 240 has a slant outer peripheral surface, which is more protruded than the outer periphery of the slant case 222.<br />[0051] Even if the cleaning member 200 continuously enters the cartridge chamber, accordingly, the stopper 240 is locked to the slant portion of the cartridge chamber, thereby preventing the cleaning member 200 from further entering the cartridge chamber.<br />[0052] Further, the stopper 240 has the rotary roller 242, thereby preventing the rotation of the rotary body 210 from being interfered. That is, if the cleaning member 200 comes in close contact with the inner periphery of the cartridge chamber by means of the stopper 240, the motor 130 is idle, but the stopper 240 is rotated in the cartridge chamber by means of the rotary roller 242.<br />[0053] Desirably, the cleaning member 200 further includes a cleaning part 250 in which a cleaning liquid is contained, and thus, the cleaning liquid is sprayed to the outside by means of the centrifugal force of the rotary body 210.<br />[0054] Therefore, the slant cleaning parts 220 and the parallel cleaning parts 230 perform the cleaning operation of the interior of the cartridge chamber by means of the rotation of the rotary body 210, and in this case, after the cleaning liquid is sprayed and coated on the interior of the cartridge chamber to remove the oil mist existing thereinto, the cleaning is performed by means of the brushes of the slant cleaning parts 220 and the parallel cleaning parts 230.<br />[0055] The cleaning member 200 has the cleaning part 250 on which holes are formed, so that the cleaning liquid contained in the cleaning part 250 is sprayed to the outside by means of the centrifugal force of the rotary body 210.<br />[0056] According to the present invention, the cleaning part 250 is formed over a given region below the stopper 240, thereby helping the efficient cleaning of the slant cleaning parts 220 and the parallel cleaning parts 230.<br />[0057] Further, the cleaning member 200 further includes a sealing member 400 made of a silicone material formed on the front side thereof, thereby preventing foreign materials from entering the interior of the muzzle.<br />[0058] If the cartridge chamber is cleaned by the cleaning member 200, all kinds of foreign materials are generated and enter the muzzle. At this time, the sealing member 400 is formed on the front surface of the cleaning member 200, thereby preventing the foreign materials from entering the muzzle.<br />[0059] In this case, the sealing member 400 is made of a soft silicone material and has a larger diameter than the cartridge chamber of the muzzle side, thereby sealing the interior of the cartridge chamber at the muzzle side.<br />[0060] According to the present invention, the handle member 300 is disposed on the rear side of the rotary member 100 in such a manner as to be adjustable in length in a telescoping manner.<br />[0061] Since the width of the outside of the cartridge chamber is smaller than the length of the cartridge chamber, accordingly, a long handle cannot be inserted into the cartridge chamber. Thus, the cleaning is performed by forcedly inserting a worker's arm into the end of the interior of the cartridge chamber, but according to the present invention, the handle member 300 is adjusted in length in the telescoping manner, thereby being sequentially extended in the cartridge chamber.<br />[0062] That is, the handle member 300 is folded to a relatively short length, and next, it is extended to multi-steps into the cartridge chamber, thereby performing the cleaning up to the end of the interior of the cartridge chamber.<br />[0063] Desirably, the handle member 300 is formed of a hollow interior in such a manner as to communicate with the rear portion of the rotary member 100, so that the electric wire is connected to the power source part 120.<br />[0064] This provides the power larger than separate batteries, and further, as the handle member 300 is formed of the hollow interior in such a manner as to communicate with the rear portion of the rotary member 100, the electric wire is desirably connected to the power source part 120.<br />[0065] Desirably, the handle member 300 is separable from the rotary member 100. This permits the cleaning apparatus to be easily kept. Accordingly, the front side of the handle member 300 and the rear side of the rotary member 100 are coupled by means of a bolt 310, and if necessary, they are separable from each other.<br />[0066] As mentioned above, the cleaning apparatus for a cartridge chamber of artillery according to the present invention is capable of at the same time cleaning the slant portion and the parallel portion formed on the internal peripheral surface of the cartridge chamber, while preventing the foreign materials existing inside the cartridge chamber from entering the interior of a muzzle and performing the storage and installation thereof in a convenient manner.<br />[0067] While the present invention has been described with reference to the particular illustrative embodiments, it is not to be restricted by the embodiments but only by the appended claims. It is to be appreciated that those skilled in the art can change or modify the embodiments without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention."
US-6659096-B1,A split-buss-cable single-cam compound archery bow substantially reduces torque exerted on the bow by the buss cable as the bow is drawn. An adjustable-width and adjustable-position splitter holds split buss cable ends in a substantially parallel spaced-apart configuration. The splitter is adapted to enable attachment at varying positions along the split buss cable and to enable adjustment of the splitter distance. The splitter may be positioned so as to substantially eliminate interference between the split buss cable and an archer's arm as the bow is drawn and released.,"Additional objects and advantages of the present invention may become apparent upon referring to the preferred and alternative embodiments of the present invention as illustrated in the drawings and described in the following written description and/or claims.<br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />FIGS. 1 and 2 are side and back views, respectively, of a prior single-cam compound archery bow.<br />FIGS. 3 and 4 are side and back views, respectively, of a single-cam compound archery bow according to the present invention.<br />FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C are top exploded, top assembled, and front assembled views, respectively, of a splitter according to the present invention.<br />FIGS. 6A, 6B, and 6C are top exploded, top assembled, and front assembled views, respectively, of a splitter according to the present invention.<br />FIGS. 7A, 7B, 7C, and 7D are top views of alternative splitters according to the present invention.<br />FIGS. 8A and 8B are side views of a splitter, tether, and fall-away arrow rest according to the present invention.<br />(1) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED AND ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br />(2) FIGS. 3 and 4 show an exemplary embodiment of a single-cam compound archery bow 100 according to the present invention. Upper and lower bow limbs 111a and 111b are shown extending from central handle portion 110 and terminating at limb tips 112a and 112b. Each limb tip is divided to accommodate a pulley assembly 120/130 and is provided with an axle for rotatably mounting each pulley assembly thereon. In this example of a single cam bow, one pulley assembly (pulley assembly 120 in this example) comprises a substantially circular idler wheel substantially concentrically mounted on the corresponding axle. The other pulley assembly (pulley assembly 130 in this example) may include multiple cams, pulleys, and/or levers and is eccentrically mounted on the corresponding axle. In the exemplary embodiment of FIGS. 3 and 4, pulley assembly 130 includes three eccentrically mounted cams. A draw cable 140 is secured to pulley assembly 130 and passes around pulley assembly 120, continuing as cable 141 (also referred to as a let-out/take-up cable). Cable 141 is secured to pulley assembly 130. A buss cable 145 (also referred to as a power cable) is secured to pulley assembly 130 at a first end, and splits into split buss cable ends 145a and 145b at the second end. Split buss cable ends 145a and 145b are secured to the axle of pulley assembly 120 on opposite sides of bow limb tip 112a. A substantially rigid buss cable splitter 160 is secured to split buss cable ends 145a and 145b and employed to hold split buss cable ends 145a and 145b in a spaced-apart configuration. A cable guard 150 and cable guard slide 152 serve to pull cable 141 laterally out of the flight path of an arrow, with cable 141 passing through cable guard slide 152 and cable guard slide 152 sliding along cable guard 150. One split buss cable end 145b may also pass through cable guard slide 152, and preferably freely slides therethrough with little or no lateral displacement. The cable guard and slide serve to pull cable 141 laterally out of the flight path of an arrow. As the bow is drawn, draw cable 140 is let out by pulley assembly 30, while cable 141 is let out by pulley assembly 130 and passes around pulley assembly 120. Buss cable 145 is taken up by pulley assembly 130. The lengths of the cables and size, shape, and configuration of pulley assembly 30 determines the force vs. draw distance characteristics of the bow, and may vary widely while remaining within the scope of inventive concepts disclosed and/or claimed herein.<br />(3) The split arrangement of buss cable 145 and split buss cable ends 145a and 145b serve to keep the buss cable out of a flight path of an arrow, without undesirable torque being exerted on bow limb 111a. This is achieved in part by securing the split buss cable ends 145a and 145b at opposite sides of bow limb tip 112a and pulley assembly 120. Split buss cable ends 145a and 145b may preferably terminate in looped ends placed around opposite ends of an axle supporting pulley assembly 120. Other suitable arrangements may be equivalently employed for securing the split buss cable ends, either directly or indirectly, to bow limb tip 112a. This substantially symmetric attachment of spit buss cable ends 145a and 145b results in substantially reduced torque exerted on the bow as it is drawn, compared to bows having a non-split buss cable pulled to the side by the cable guard/slide. By making the first end (i.e., the non-split portion) of buss cable 145 sufficiently long, the splitter 160 and split buss cable end 145a may be positioned so as to substantially eliminate interference with the archer's arm as he/she draws and/or releases the bow. Splitter 160 is shown above a grip portion of central handle 110 in the exemplary embodiment of FIGS. 3 and 4. Preferably, the splitter position is chosen so that at substantially full draw of the bow the splitter does not reach the arm of the archer. Splitter 160 may preferably be constructed to enable removing and re-securing the splitter at varying positions along split buss cable ends 145a and 145b. In this way various cable geometries may be employed for adjusting the performance of the compound bow. In previous splitter designs (for dual-cam compound bows), the splitter, or attachment hardware therefor, is tied directly into the split buss cable ends, thereby fixing the position of the splitter and preventing any subsequent adjustment of the compound bow.<br />(4) To further reduce torque on the bow 100 as it is drawn, split buss cable ends 145a and 145b are preferably substantially parallel when held in a spaced-apart configuration by splitter 160. A different splitter 160 may therefore be designed for each different compound bow so that the splitter width (alternatively, splitter distance) substantially matches the width of the attachments of split buss cable ends at the bow limb tip. Alternatively, the splitter may preferably be constructed so as to enable adjustment of the splitter distance. In this way, a single adjustable splitter may be used with a variety of compound bows having various widths for the attachment of the split buss cable ends.<br />(5) A preferred embodiment for a splitter is shown in FIGS. 5A (top, exploded), 5B (top, assembled), and 5C (front). The splitter includes first and second cable clamps secured to a central member 166. Each of the cable clamps preferably includes a main clamp member 162a/164a secured to the central member 166, and a secondary clamp member 162b/164b secured to the corresponding main clamp member 162a/164a by at least one clamp fastener 162c/164c. A split buss cable end may be clamped between a main clamp member and secondary clamp member urged together and secured together by clamp fastener(s). Threaded fasteners are shown, but any suitable fastener may be employed that enables removing and re-securing a split buss cable end between clamp members 162a/162b and /or 164a/164b while remaining within the scope of inventive concepts disclosed and/or claimed herein. Grooves 162d/164d may be provided for receiving the split buss cable ends 145a/145b. The clamp arrangement enables removing and re-securing of splitter 160 at varying points along the lengths of split buss cable ends 145a and 145b.<br />(6) Main clamp members 162a/164a are shown threadedly engaged with central member 166, thereby securing main clamp members 162a/164a to central member 166. This threaded embodiment is preferred enabling adjustment of the splitter distance. Main clamp members 162a/164a may be threaded into central member 166 to varying degrees, thereby varying the splitter distance. The threads are preferably of opposite handedness for main clamp members 162a/a64a so that the splitter distance may be adjusted with the splitter already clamped onto the split buss cable ends. In an alternative embodiment, the threads may be of the same handedness, and adjustment of the splitter distance may be performed prior to clamping the splitter onto the split buss cable ends. In an alternative embodiment, central member 166 may be provided with one or more flat surfaces, one or more knurled surfaces, one or more holes, or other suitable structure(s) for facilitating adjustment of the splitter distance by hand or by using a wrench or other suitable tool. In an alternative embodiment, central member may be rigidly secured to one of main clamp members 162a/164a and threadedly engaged with the other. In an alternative embodiment, any other suitable mechanism for enabling adjustment of the splitter distance may be equivalently employed while remaining within the scope of inventive concepts disclosed and/or claimed herein.<br />(7) In the embodiment of FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C, fasteners 162c and 164c urge clamp members 162a/162b and 164a/164b, respectively, together in a direction substantially perpendicular to central member 166. In an alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. 6A. 6B, and 6C, clamp members are shown urged together by clam fasteners in a direction substantially parallel to central member 166. In the embodiment of FIGS. 5A, 5B, and 5C, grooves 162d/164d are shown provided on main clamp members 162a/164a for receiving the split buss cable-ends. Grooves 162d/162d may alternatively be provided on secondary clamp members 162b/164b (alternative embodiment of FIG. 7A), or on both main clamp members 162a/164a and secondary clamp members 162b/164b (alternative embodiments of FIGS. 6A, 6B, 6C, and 7B). In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 7D, no grooves are provided. In an alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 7C, multiple grooves may be provided, enabling coarse adjustment of the splitter distance through the choice of groove for receiving a split buss cable end. Multiple grooves are shown in main clamp members 162a/164a, but may alternatively be provided in secondary clamp members 162b/164b, or in both main and secondary clamp members. In the alternative embodiment of FIG. 7B, only one fastener 162c/164c is shown for each cable clamp. Use of a single fastener or multiple fasteners may be employed in various of the embodiments disclosed herein as desired.<br />(8) A groove or slot 169 may be provided on central member 166 for enabling attachment of a tether 170 for a fall-away arrow rest 180 (FIGS. 8A and 8B). Movement of the splitter during release of the arrow may therefore actuate the fall-away rest, allowing it to fall away from the arrow during the initial stage of the arrow's flight.<br />(9) A split-buss-cable single-cam compound bow according to the present invention may preferably be constructed using pre-stretched cables. The use of pre-stretched cables reduces movement and/or mis-alignment of the splitter as the bow is repeatedly drawn and released during use.<br />(10) It should be appreciated that an adjustable-width and/or adjustable-position splitter according to the present invention may be employed in constructing split-buss-cable dual-cam compound bows, in addition to the split-buss-cable single-cam compound bows of the present invention. Use of an adjustable-width and/or adjustable-position splitter in a dual-cam bow enables adjustment of cable configuration in a manner similar to that described hereinabove for a single-cam bow.<br />(11) The present invention has been set forth in the forms of its preferred and alternative embodiments. These embodiments are illustrative and not intended to limit the scope of the claims set forth hereinbelow. It is intended that modifications to the disclosed split-buss-cable single-cam compound bow and/or adjustable-width/position splitter may be made without departing from inventive concepts disclosed and/or claimed herein."

The magazine 10 comprises a generally cylindrical outer housing 12, a bottom end cap 14 and a top end cap 16. The top end cap 16 has a feeder 18 which feeds the cartridges stored within the housing 12 into the firing chamber of a gun. The feeder 18 has a feed ramp (not shown) which extends from a helical ramp 30 (see FIGS. 2-4) to the opening 20 at the top of the feeder 18. A pair of retractable or pliable retention tabs 22 hold the cartridges within the magazine 10 when it is not attached to a gun.<br />[0027] The magazine 10 may be permanently attached to a gun, such as by being integrally formed with the gun, welded to the gun, or otherwise affixed to the gun in a manner not intended to be removed. In such case, the magazine 10 is attached to the gun with the opening 20 of the feeder 18 outlets into the firing chamber of the gun.<br />[0028] More preferably, the magazine 10 is detachable from the gun such that the gun can be simply and quickly reloaded by removing one magazine 10 and installing another magazine 10. In a detachable configuration, the top end cap 16 may have an attachment interface which connects to a receptacle interface on the gun. For example, the feeder 18 may be configured with a detent that detachably connects to the receptacle interface on the gun. In this way, only a part of the feeder 18 needs to insert into the receptacle interface on the gun. Alternatively, the receptacle interface on the gun can be a receptacle that receives and encloses the entire magazine (similar to the way a clip inserts into the handle of some types of pistols).<br />[0029] The magazine 10 may be configured to function as a handle on a gun. For example, the outer housing 12 may have finger grips, grooves, or knurling, so that a user may hold onto the magazine when using the gun. In such a configuration, the magazine 10 is attached to the gun in a location which is suitable for handling the gun, when shooting the gun, and/or when carrying the gun. For instance, in FIG. 8a, on a rifle, the magazine 10 may be located on a rifle 72 where a user would hold the rifle 72 with one hand, while the other hand holds the gun near the trigger, in another example shown in FIG. 8b, the magazine 10 may be located at the handle of a pistol 90, so that the user holds the magazine 10, and can also reach the trigger with the trigger finger. The magazine 10 is located at the butt end of the pistol 90 and extends at about a right angle from the barrel 92 and firing chamber of the pistol 90.<br />[0030] The magazine 10 shown in FIG. 1 has the same or similar elements and configuration in each of the different embodiments 10a and 10b described below.<br />[0031] Turning now to FIGS. 2-4, the interior of the gun magazine 10a according to one embodiment of the present invention is shown. The outer housing 12 of the gun magazine 10a has a substantially cylindrical inner wall surface 32. The cylindrical inner wall surface 32 has a center axis 34 at the center of the cylindrical inner wall surface 32. An inner support member 36 is disposed within the outer housing 12 and has a substantially cylindrical outer wall surface 38 which is concentric and opposing the inner wall surface 32 of the outer housing 12. In the embodiment of FIGS. 2-4, the inner support member 36 is comprised of a plurality of cylindrical segments which extend the length of the magazine 10a. The segments are separated by a helical slot 40 for accommodating a pusher assembly 42.<br />[0032] The outer wall surface 38 and the inner wall surface 32 form a gap between them having a toroidal cross section. The helical ramp 30 is disposed within the gap. The helical ramp 30 spirals around the center axis 34 such that the helical ramp 30 is concentric to the inner wall surface 32 and outer wall surface 38. The pitch of the helical ramp (the width of one complete helix turn measured parallel to the axis of the helix) is slightly larger than the width of the cartridges 44 which the magazine 10a is designed to handle. Thus, the helical ramp 30 forms a helical gap between turns of the ramp which is sized and configured to receive the cartridges 44. Moreover, the helical ramp 30 is configured to receive the cartridges 44 such that the longitudinal axis of each cartridge is oriented radially of the inner wall surface 32 (pointing along a radius of the substantially cylindrical wall) within the helical gap formed by the helical ramp 30.<br />[0033] The magazine 10a also comprises a drive mechanism, which is a pusher assembly 42 in the embodiment of FIGS. 2-4. The pusher assembly 42 comprises a spring 48 slidably disposed on a spring support bar 46. The spring 48 as shown in the embodiment of FIGS. 2-4 is a flat, torsion spring, but may be any suitable torsion spring. The spring support bar 46 extends from the bottom end of the helical ramp 30 to the top end of the helical ramp 30. The spring support bar 46 has a linear groove 50 extending along its entire length for receiving the inner end of the spring 48, which prevents the inner end of the spring 48 from rotating. A pusher 52 is coupled to the outer end of the spring 48. The pusher 52 may be a bar that bears against the first cartridge 44 within the magazine, or a tray that holds the first cartridge, or other suitable structure for pushing the cartridges along the helical ramp 30. The pusher 52 extends through the helical slot 40 in the inner support member 36. The pusher 52 may also have a guide part 54 that slides along a helical groove 56 in the inner wall surface 32 of the outer housing 12. The helical groove 56 may be positioned about midway between each turn of the helical ramp 30. The guide 54 part and helical groove 56 provide support for the pusher 52 so that the pusher does not get stuck or out of proper position.<br />[0034] In another aspect, the tips of the bullets may also be received within the helical groove 56 to provide support for the cartridges 44. This helps keep the cartridges properly spaced and aligned within the magazine 10a, thereby preventing jamming of the magazine 10a. Alternatively, a separate helical tip groove may be provided in the inner wail surface 32 for receiving the tips of the bullets. The separate tip groove may be above or below the helical guide groove 56, or even over the helical guide groove (for example, the guide groove 56 can be deeper in the inner wall surface than the tip groove).<br />[0035] The function of the magazine 10a is very straight forward. To load the magazine 10a, cartridges are pushed into the feeder 18. The first cartridge pushed into the feeder 18 engages the pusher 52, which is at the top of the helical ramp 30 when the magazine 10a is empty. As additional cartridges are loaded into the feeder 18, the pusher 52 is pushed down and around the helical ramp 30, which in turn winds the spring 48 against the torsional force of the spring 48. The spring 48 also slides down the spring support bar 46 as the pusher 52 travels down the helical ramp 30. After the magazine 10a is loaded, the magazine is installed on a gun. The spring 48 exerts a torsional force on the pusher 52, which in turn pushes the cartridges up the helical ramp 30, out of the feeder 18, and into the firing chamber of the gun. As the cartridges 44 in the magazine are delivered out of the feeder 18 and fired by the gun, the pusher assembly 42 pushes the cartridges 44 up the helical ramp toward the feeder 18. FIG. 3 shows the magazine 10a with more cartridges within the magazine 10a, while FIG. 4 shows that the some of the cartridges have been spent or removed from the magazine 10a. As can be seen by comparing Fig, 3 to FIG. 4, as the pusher 52 pushes the cartridges up the ramp 30 by rotating around the center axis 34, the spring 48 moves upward by sliding along the spring support bar 46.<br />[0036] Referring now to FIGS. 5-7, the interior of a gun magazine 1.0b according to another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The gun magazine 10b has many of the same, or very similar components as the magazine 10a, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements. Therefore, the description above with the respect to the magazine 10a applies equally for like elements utilized in the magazine 10b. The main difference between the magazine 10b and magazine 10a is the drive mechanism.<br />[0037] The pusher assembly of the magazine 10b comprises a pusher 52 which is attached to a spring 62 The spring 62 may be a zig-zag spring as shown FIGS. 5-7, or other suitable spring. The spring 62 is arranged along the helical ramp 30 in a helical path. The top end of the spring 62 is attached to the pusher 52. The bottom end of the spring 62 may bear against a stop at the bottom of the magazine 10b, or the bottom end cap 14.<br />[0038] Like the magazine 10a, the pusher 52 for magazine 10b may have a guide part 54 that slides along a helical groove 56 in the inner wall surface 32 of the outer housing 12. The helical groove 56 may be positioned about midway between each turn of the helical ramp 30.<br />[0039] To support the inside end of the pusher 52, the pusher 52 may have an inside guide part (not shown) that is received in an inside helical groove in the outer wall surface 38 of the inner support member 36.<br />[0040] As with magazine 10a described above, the tips of the bullets in magazine 10b may also be received within the helical groove 56 to provide support for the cartridges 44. This helps keep the cartridges properly spaced and aligned within the magazine 10a, thereby preventing jamming of the magazine 10a. Alternatively, a separate helical tip groove 64 may be provided in the inner wall surface 32 for receiving the tips of the bullets. The separate tip groove 64 may be above or below the helical guide groove 56, or even over the helical guide groove (for example, the guide groove 56 can be deeper in the inner wall surface than the tip groove). As shown in FIG. 1, the helical tip groove may extend all the way into the feeder 18.<br />[0041] The function of the magazine 10b is very similar to the function of the magazine 10a, except that instead of compressing and decompressing a torsional spring, the movement of the pusher 52 and cartridges 44 compress the spring 62 which is placed along the helical ramp 30. The first cartridge pushed into the feeder 18 engages the pusher 52, which is at the top of the helical ramp 30 when the magazine 10b is empty. As additional cartridges are loaded into the feeder 18, the pusher 52 is pushed down and around the helical ramp 30, which in turn compresses the spring 62 against the spring force of the spring 62. The top end of the spring 62 travels down the helical ramp 30 as the pusher 52 travels down the helical ramp 30. After the magazine 10b is loaded, the magazine is installed on a gun. The spring 62 exerts a spring force on the pusher 52, which in turn pushes the cartridges up the helical ramp 30, out of the feeder 18, and into the firing chamber of the gun. As the cartridges 44 in the magazine are delivered out of the feeder 18 and fired by the gun, the pusher assembly 60 pushes the cartridges 44 up the helical ramp toward the feeder 18. FIG. 6 shows the magazine 10b with more cartridges within the magazine 10b, while FIG. 7 shows that the some of the cartridges have been spent or removed from the magazine 10b. As can be seen by comparing FIG. 6 to FIG. 7, as the pusher 52 pushes the cartridges up the ramp 30, the top end of the spring 62 moves up the ramp 30.<br />[0042] in another aspect of the present invention, as shown in FIG. 9, the casing of the cartridges 44 may have a radial groove 80 which receives a guide rail 82 on the helical ramp 30. The guide rail 82 is positioned on the ramp 30 to align with the radial groove 80 and the guide rail 82 extends from the bottom of the helical ramp 30 to the top of the helical ramp, along a helical path. The guide rail 82 may also extend into the feeder 18 (see FIG. 1). The radial groove and 80 and guide rail 82 also helps to keep the cartridges properly aligned in a radial orientation with the magazine, which also helps to prevent jamming within the magazine. Optionally, a second guide rail 84 parallel may also be provided on the bottom side of the helical ramp 30 which is also received within the radial groove 80, and provides additional support to the cartridges 44. In another aspect, the casing of the cartridges 44 can have two or more radial grooves side by side on the casing of the cartridges 44, which are received in the same number of parallel guide rails 82 and/or 84 provided on the helical ramp 30. Any of the magazines 10a, 10b, or other magazine may be provided with the one or more guide rails 82 and/or 84, according to the present invention. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 1, the guide rail 18 may extend all the way into the feeder 18.<br />[0043] Turning to FIG. 8, a magazine and gun system 70 according to yet another embodiment of the present invention is shown. The system 70 comprises a magazine 10, such as magazine 10a or 10b described above, and a gun 72 comprising a barrel 74 and a magazine interface 76. The magazine 10 is attached to the magazine interface 76 such that the feeder 18 of the magazine 10 delivers the cartridges to the firing chamber of the gun 72. The magazine 10 is oriented such that the center axis 34 is substantially perpendicular to the barrel 74 of the gun 72.<br />[0044] The magazine 10 may be permanently attached to the gun 72, or it may be detachable, as described above. In a detachable configuration, the gun preferably has a magazine interface receptacle, and the magazine detachably connects to the gun using a detent. Alternatively, other suitable attachment arrangements may be utilized.<br />[0045] While the present invention has been fully described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that many modifications thereof may be made without departing from the principles and concepts set forth herein. Hence, the proper scope of the present invention should be determined only by the broadest interpretation of the appended claims so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalents."

Similarly, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 9B</figref>, the mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>b </i>is undercut so that the trench <b>43</b><i>b </i>and at least part of the second mount surface <b>36</b><i>b </i>are located closer to the centerline C than the rim <b>41</b><i>b</i>. This undercut configuration provides the mounting portion <b>30</b> with a dovetail shape that defines cavities <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>. In an embodiment not shown, the mounting portion <b>30</b> can define a single undercut cavity configured to mate with an archery accessory <b>100</b>.<br />(73) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> illustrate a cross section along line A-A (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>), showing plane W extending through both cavities <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the dovetail structure or mounting portion <b>30</b> and between the forward facing surface <b>22</b> and the rearward facing surface <b>24</b> of the archery riser <b>20</b>. As shown, the mounting portion <b>30</b> defines the cavities <b>40</b><i>a</i>, <b>40</b><i>b</i>. The specific shape of the mounting portion <b>30</b> depends on the orientation of the first mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>and the second mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>b </i>with respect to each other. In an embodiment, the mounting portion <b>30</b> is configured to be received by and retained by an archery accessory <b>100</b> to releasably couple the archery accessory <b>100</b> to the archery riser <b>20</b> of the bow <b>10</b>.<br />(74) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 11-12</figref>, the first and second mounting sub-portions <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>are undercut to create an angle α that is less than 90°. In an embodiment, the angle α is less than 70°. In another embodiment, the angle α is less than 60°. In still another embodiment, the angle α is less than 50°. Depending upon the embodiment, the angle α can be any acute angle. As shown, cavity <b>40</b><i>a </i>is associated with, is partially defined by, and spans angle α<b>1</b>. Likewise, cavity <b>40</b><i>b </i>is associated with, is partially defined by and spans angle α<b>2</b>. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 12</figref>, an angle δ exists between each of the second mount surfaces <b>36</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>b</i>. In this embodiment, angle δ is greater than 90°. In an embodiment, the angle δ is equal to or substantially 100°. In another embodiment, the angle δ is greater than 100°. Depending upon the embodiment, angle δ can be any obtuse angle.<br />(75) In comparison, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 13</figref>, a prior art bow riser includes a coupling portion <b>70</b> disclosed in FIG. 8 of U.S. Pat. No. 9,829,270 issued on Nov. 28, 2017. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 13</figref> is a cross sectional view of the prior art coupling portion <b>70</b>, taken along a line from a rearward facing surface <b>77</b> to a forward facing surface <b>79</b>. The prior art coupling portion <b>70</b> has a first side surface <b>71</b>, a first surface <b>72</b>, a second surface <b>74</b>, a third surface <b>75</b>, and a second side surface <b>78</b>. The second surface <b>74</b> extends at an angle β relative to the third surface <b>75</b>, where β is not less than 90°.<br />(76) The prior art coupling portion <b>70</b> differs from the mounting portion <b>30</b> in numerous aspects. In one aspect, angle α (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 12</figref>) of mounting portion <b>30</b> is less than 90° in contrast to angle β of the prior art coupling portion <b>70</b>. The relatively large angle β (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 13</figref>) of the prior art coupling portion <b>70</b> has several disadvantages. For example, this large angle β makes it difficult to secure accessories to the prior art coupling portion <b>70</b>. The difficulty is caused by a reduction in counteractive forces from the coupling portion <b>70</b>. This large angle β reduces the compressive or securing forces that the coupling portion <b>70</b> can apply to an accessory. In contrast, the relatively small angle α (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 12</figref>) enhances the entrapment of the accessory, providing an important improvement for accessory securement and adjustability. This enables the mounting portion <b>30</b> to apply increased securing forces to entrap the accessory after the accessory's position is set. Also, during the position adjustment of the accessory, the relatively small angle α aids in restraining the movement of the accessory to a predetermined path with less variability than the prior art coupling portion <b>70</b>.<br />(77) In the embodiment shown, the mounting sub-portions <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>are symmetrical relative to center line C (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>). That is, the structure, geometry and cavities of mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>are identical to, but mirror images of, the structure, geometry and cavities of mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>b</i>. In other embodiments, there are structural or geometric differences between mounting sub-portions <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b. </i><br />(78) Archery Riser Mount<br />(79) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 14-16</figref>, an archery accessory <b>100</b> can be mounted to the mounting sub-portions <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 4-13</figref>) of the archery riser <b>20</b>.

The locking bore <b>188</b> is configured to accept a locking fastener <b>190</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 30</figref>) in the locking mode to couple the locking device <b>180</b> to the housing <b>160</b> to lock the archery riser mount <b>110</b> in place on the archery riser <b>20</b>.<br />(88) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 27</figref>, the outer surface <b>181</b> further includes a locking device riser engager <b>185</b> that is configured to engage the first mount surface <b>34</b><i>b </i>and second mount surface <b>36</b><i>b </i>of mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref>) of the archery riser <b>20</b> in the positioning mode (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 30</figref>). As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 27</figref>, the outer surface <b>181</b> of the locking device <b>180</b> defines a positioning window <b>183</b> that include a series of decals, etched or embossed markings or other adjustment measure markings <b>191</b> to aid in the repeatability of the vertical position adjustment of the archery riser mount <b>110</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 30</figref>, when the user rotates the knob <b>154</b>, the accessory support <b>150</b> moves vertically relative to the archery riser <b>20</b>, and the user can stop the movement at a desired position where the clamp indicator <b>193</b> points at one of the measure markings <b>191</b>.<br />(89) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 17, 22 and 29-33</figref>, a user can install the archery riser mount <b>110</b> on the archery riser <b>20</b> through the following steps: (a) A shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 32B</figref>, the user removes the locking device <b>180</b> from the accessory <b>100</b>/<b>101</b> by fully unscrewing the locking fastener <b>190</b>. (b) At this point, the housing <b>160</b> and knob <b>154</b> remain coupled to the archery riser mount <b>110</b>. (c) In an adjustment mode, the user can loosen the positioning fastener <b>130</b> until the first and second clamp portions <b>114</b>, <b>134</b> form a jaw size great enough to fit over the rearward facing surface <b>24</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref>). (d) The user attaches the archery riser mount <b>110</b> (including clamp portions <b>114</b>, <b>134</b>) to the mounting portion <b>30</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>) of the archery riser <b>20</b>. (e) The user partially tightens the positioning fastener <b>130</b>. (f) The user slides the archery riser mount <b>110</b> (including clamp portions <b>114</b>, <b>134</b>) upward or downward until reaching a desired, preliminary or initial vertical position on the archery riser <b>20</b>. This initial position of the accessory <b>100</b>/<b>101</b> relative to the archery riser <b>20</b> may be preliminary, not necessarily, the final, fine-tuned position. (g) The user fully tightens the positioning fastener <b>130</b>, thereby generating an initial compression force on the archery riser <b>20</b>. (h) Next, the user rotates the knob <b>154</b> clockwise or counterclockwise to make a secondary adjustment—micro or fine tune adjustments of the vertical position of the accessory <b>100</b>/<b>101</b> relative to the archery riser <b>20</b>. (i) Once the use settles on a final vertical position, the user initiates the locking mode. (j) In the locking mode, the user attaches the locking device <b>180</b> to the housing <b>160</b>. (k) The user screws the locking fastener <b>190</b> to tighten the locking device <b>180</b> onto the housing <b>160</b>, which generates a final compression force on the archery riser <b>20</b>, which is greater than the initial compression force. As illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 32C</figref>, during this tightening process, the locking device riser engager <b>185</b> engages the first and second mount surfaces <b>34</b><i>b</i>, <b>36</b><i>b </i>of mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref>), and the housing riser engager <b>165</b> engages the first and second mount surfaces <b>34</b><i>a</i>, <b>36</b><i>a </i>of mounting sub-portion <b>30</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref>). As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 21 and 32C</figref>, in this configuration, the locking device riser engager <b>185</b> surrounds the clamp portion <b>134</b>. Likewise, the housing riser engager <b>165</b> surrounds the first clamp portion <b>114</b>. (l) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 22</figref>, the vertical adjuster <b>153</b> is immobilized because the knob <b>154</b> and stopper <b>157</b> are fixedly connected to the vertical adjuster <b>153</b>, and the housing top <b>161</b> is trapped between (and engaged with) the stopper <b>157</b> and knob <b>154</b>. (m) Since the housing <b>160</b> is locked in position relative to the archery riser <b>20</b>, the vertical adjuster <b>153</b> is also locked in position relative to the archery riser <b>20</b>, preventing or inhibiting any unintentional movement of the vertical adjuster <b>153</b>, such as forces caused by inadvertent contact between the knob <b>154</b> and people or the environment.<br/>Archery Accessory Adjustment Assembly<br />(90) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 34-39</figref>, an archery accessory adjustment assembly <b>200</b> is configured to allow adjustment of an archery accessory element <b>227</b> of an archery accessory <b>100</b> in relation to the housing <b>160</b>, accessory support <b>150</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 20</figref>) or archery riser mount <b>110</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 22</figref>).

As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>, the first extension <b>210</b> further includes a first drive interface <b>212</b> that, in an embodiment, includes a first threaded area <b>211</b>. In an embodiment, the first extension <b>210</b> and the archery mount X are formed as a single integrated unit. In another embodiment, the first extension <b>210</b> is separate from, but connected to, the archery mount X using any suitable fastener or securement method.<br />(92) A second extension <b>220</b> extends along a second extension plane <b>305</b> and is configured to couple to a knob <b>226</b> or handle at one end via a coupling stem <b>225</b>. The coupling stem <b>225</b> of the second extension <b>220</b> is configured to protrude from the end of the archery accessory to receive a portion of the adjustment knob <b>226</b>, insert into a portion of the adjustment knob <b>226</b> or otherwise couple to the adjustment knob <b>226</b>. In an embodiment, the adjustment knob <b>226</b> is press-fit, screwed onto or fixedly attached to the coupling stem <b>225</b>. As a result, the twisting of the adjustment knob <b>226</b> causes the rotation of the second extension <b>220</b>.<br />(93) The second extension <b>220</b> further includes a second drive interface <b>222</b> that includes, in an embodiment, a second threaded area <b>221</b>. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 36B</figref>, the adjustment knob <b>226</b> and the second drive interface <b>222</b> may be formed as separate components that are coupled together during assembly of the archery accessory adjustment assembly <b>200</b>. In another embodiment, the components of the second extension <b>220</b> and adjustment knob <b>226</b> may be formed as a single integrated unit. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 37</figref>, the first threaded area <b>211</b> of the first drive interface <b>212</b> and the second threaded area <b>221</b> of the second drive interface <b>222</b> are configured to mate or threadably interact with each other when the archery adjustment assembly <b>200</b> is in the assembled state as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 36B</figref>.<br />(94) In an embodiment, the second drive interface <b>222</b> is rounded and substantially cylindrical in shape, and the first drive interface <b>212</b> has a substantially cylindrical shape having an arc-shaped, concave surface configured to partially receive the second drive interface <b>222</b>. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 39</figref>, in order to assemble the archery adjustment accessory <b>200</b>, the second extension <b>220</b> is positioned against the first extension <b>210</b> such that the first drive interface <b>212</b> contacts the second drive interface <b>222</b>. The archery accessory element <b>227</b>, such as an arrow rest device (or portion thereof), sandwiches the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>.<br />(95) As shown, the first and second drive interfaces <b>212</b>, <b>222</b> threadably engage with each other such that rotation of the adjustment knob <b>226</b> causes the second drive interface <b>222</b> to rotate about a longitudinal axis of the second extension <b>220</b> and move relative to the first extension <b>210</b> along the first drive interface <b>212</b>. Movement of the second extension <b>220</b> along the first drive interface <b>212</b> results in movement of the archery accessory element <b>227</b> relative to the first extension <b>210</b> along an axis that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the first extension <b>210</b>. Likewise, movement of the second extension <b>220</b> along the first drive interface <b>212</b> also results in movement of the archery accessory element <b>227</b> towards or away from the archery riser <b>20</b>.<br />(96) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 39B</figref>, the engagement of the first threaded area <b>211</b> of the first drive interface <b>212</b> with the second threaded area <b>221</b> of the second drive interface <b>222</b> results in a gap <b>230</b>. This gap <b>230</b> causes or enables an additional movement between the first extension <b>210</b> and the second extension <b>220</b> after the position of the second extension <b>220</b> relative to the first extension <b>210</b> has been set by the adjustment knob <b>226</b>. This additional movement, referred to as slop or play, is undesirable. This undesirable movement can be increased as the result of imperfections in manufacturing tolerances of the first threaded area <b>211</b> of the first drive interface <b>212</b> and the second threaded area <b>221</b> of the second drive interface <b>222</b>. The slop in the threads can lead to inaccuracies, errors and imprecisions during the adjustment and use of the archery accessory element <b>227</b>.<br />(97) In a securement mode, an accessory securement member <b>232</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 38</figref>) is configured to decrease or eliminate slop between the first drive interface <b>212</b> and the second drive interface <b>222</b>. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 39-41 and 49</figref>, the archery accessory element <b>227</b> may have a base <b>314</b> that includes a plurality of spaced-apart element portions <b>307</b>, <b>309</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 49</figref>) that define or entrap a cavity or passageway <b>318</b>. The archery accessory element <b>227</b> further defines an archery accessory opening <b>331</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 49</figref>) configured to accept the accessory securement member <b>232</b>. A user can install the archery accessory element <b>227</b> onto the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> by sliding the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> through the passageway <b>318</b>. Then, the user can rotate and tighten the accessory securement member <b>232</b> until the element portions <b>307</b>, <b>309</b> are firmly compressed onto the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>.<br />(98) During the compression process, the diameter of the passageway <b>318</b> is gradually decreased. The element portions <b>307</b>, <b>309</b> exert or apply a securing force <b>311</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 36A</figref>) that compresses the element portions <b>307</b>, <b>309</b> onto the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. The securing force <b>311</b> acts along a force direction or force axis <b>313</b> that intersects with at least (or, as in the embodiment shown) each of the extension plans <b>303</b>, <b>305</b>. This securing force <b>311</b> acts to decrease or eliminate the gap <b>230</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 39B</figref>) between the first drive interface <b>212</b> and the second drive interface <b>222</b>, thereby reducing or eliminating slop and securing the second extension <b>220</b> in position relative to the first extension <b>210</b> in a secured state. While in the securement mode, the first extension <b>210</b> is, therefore, fixedly secured to the second extension <b>220</b> despite separation forces caused by contact with users, the environment and shooting vibrations. In one embodiment, in this secured state, the threaded areas <b>211</b>, <b>221</b> are in direct, physical contact with each other with no gap <b>230</b> between them. In another embodiment, in this secured state, the threaded areas <b>211</b>, <b>221</b> are in direct, physical contact with each other with a minimal or reduced gap <b>230</b> between them. The elimination or reduction of thread slop improves the adjustment control of the user by providing increased, mechanical responsiveness to the fine tune adjustments performed by the user's incremental rotation of the adjustment knob <b>226</b>.<br />(99) Projectile Support Device<br />(100) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 40-49</figref>, an archery projectile support device <b>300</b> can include two halves that are connected together or can include multiple spaced-apart portions that are joined or integrated at one or more ends. The latter embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 40-49</figref> and is described below. In an embodiment, the projectile support device <b>300</b> includes a top end <b>302</b>, a bottom end <b>304</b>, a front <b>306</b> configured to face toward a target T (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>), a rear <b>308</b> configured to face in a direction opposite of the target T, and left and right sides <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>, respectively. A base <b>314</b> is located proximate the bottom end <b>304</b> and defines the passageway <b>318</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 48A</figref>) that extends at least partially through the base <b>314</b> between the ends of the right and left sides <b>310</b>, <b>312</b>. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 38 and 42</figref>, the passageway <b>318</b> is configured to at least partially house the first extension <b>210</b> and the second extension <b>220</b> of the archery adjustment assembly <b>200</b>. One of the ends of the passageway <b>318</b> is open such as the right side <b>319</b> of base <b>314</b> as illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 42</figref>. In the embodiment shown, the left side <b>321</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 41</figref>) of base <b>314</b> is at least partially closed. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 41</figref>, the left side <b>321</b> includes or defines a coupling stem channel or opening <b>325</b> that is configured to allow the coupling stem <b>225</b> of the second extensions <b>220</b> to protrude from the passageway <b>318</b> when the projectile support device <b>300</b> is positioned onto the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> of the archery adjustment assembly <b>200</b>.<br />(101) The base <b>314</b> also defines a flex slot, flex gap or flex space <b>331</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 46 and 49</figref>) that facilitates the flexing of the element portions <b>307</b>, <b>309</b> when the base <b>314</b> is compressed onto the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>, as described above. Also, the base defines a slot or slit <b>332</b> that extends generally from the passageway <b>318</b> to the bottom end <b>304</b> of the projectile support device <b>300</b>. The slit <b>332</b> is configured to enable the passageway <b>318</b> of the base <b>314</b> to expand to easily receive the first extension <b>210</b> and the second extension <b>220</b>.<br />(102) As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 40</figref>, the archery accessory securement member <b>232</b> is configured to be inserted into the archery accessory opening <b>331</b> and tightened to exert radial compression on the base <b>314</b>, and thereby at least partially close the slit <b>332</b>. This acts to constrict the diameter of the passageway <b>318</b>, which exerts a radial securing force <b>311</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 36A</figref>) on the first and second extensions <b>210</b>, <b>220</b>. Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 40</figref> again, the radial securing force <b>311</b> exerted by the base <b>314</b> acts to eliminate, minimize or reduce the gap <b>230</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 39B</figref>) between the first and second drive interfaces <b>212</b>, <b>222</b>.<br />(103) In an embodiment, the projectile support device <b>300</b> also has a plurality of ear-shaped projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> extending upward from the base <b>314</b>. The projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> include a front surface <b>344</b> that generally faces the target T and a rear surface <b>346</b> that generally faces the archer or in the opposite direction of the front surface <b>344</b>. As shown, the projectile support device <b>300</b> has two projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, however in other embodiments, the projectile support device <b>300</b> may have more than two projectile guides. A plurality of bridges, trusses or cross members <b>350</b> extend between the front surface <b>344</b> and the rear surface <b>346</b>. A plurality of cavities <b>352</b> are defined within the projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>. In the embodiment shown, the cavities <b>352</b> are bounded by: (a) the front surface <b>344</b>; (b) the rear surface <b>346</b>; and (c) the cross members <b>350</b>. The cavities <b>352</b> may act to decrease manufacturing costs as well as the overall weight of the projectile support device <b>300</b> by decreasing the amount of material needed to fabricate the projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>.<br />(104) In an embodiment, the projectile support device <b>300</b> includes one or more inserts or elements (not shown) that are securely positioned within one or more of the cavities <b>352</b>. Depending upon the embodiment, the elements can include weighted members or weights, vibration dampeners, vibration reducers, light sources (e.g., light emitting diodes), luminescent elements, electrical elements, sensors, motion detectors or other electronic input/output devices that include a battery power source. The use of weight members can improve the overall balance and performance of the projectile support device <b>300</b>. The use of vibration dampeners can improve overall balance and decrease vibrations caused by the operation of the projectile support device <b>300</b>. In an embodiment, the elements are coupled to the projectile support device <b>300</b> through a press-fit or friction-fit securement or through use of an adhesive. The vibration dampeners can include springs, foam, rubber, silicone, polyurethane or any other resilient material capable of reducing vibrations.<br />(105) In an embodiment, the projectile support device <b>300</b> also has a projectile support surface <b>360</b>. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 43</figref>, the projectile support surfaced <b>360</b> is configured to support a projectile <b>11</b> that is positioned between the projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 44 and 48A-48B</figref>, the projectile support surface <b>360</b> extends the length of an arc distance D from the front <b>306</b> and rear <b>308</b> sides of the projectile support device <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 44, 48A-48B and 49</figref>, the projectile support surface <b>360</b> extends along the arc distance D in accordance with a relatively large radius R for the arc. For example, the radius R of the arc distance D can be within the range of 0.33 inches to 0.35 inches to support an archery arrow having an arrow diameter AD (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 48B-48C</figref>) within the range of 0.230 inches to 0.45 inches. This relatively large radius of the projectile support surface <b>360</b> reduces the contact force between the projectile <b>11</b> and the projectile support device <b>300</b>.<br />(106) In contrast to the prior art launcher <b>365</b> shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 48B</figref>, the force applied to the projectile support surface <b>360</b> is distributed over a greater surface area, which leads to a reduction in wear, tear and deterioration of the projectile <b>11</b> as it travels and slides across the projectile support surface <b>360</b>. The prior art launcher <b>365</b> has a relatively narrow support surface <b>367</b> that includes relatively sharp corners or an edge <b>369</b>. When the prior art launcher <b>365</b> rotates or pivots relative to the projectile <b>11</b>, the edge <b>369</b> make physical contact with the projectile <b>11</b>, scraping, wearing, damaging and deteriorating the projectile <b>11</b>. The projectile support surface <b>360</b>, in contrast, has no edges or minimal edges, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 48C</figref>. As a result, the projectile support surface <b>360</b> avoids or minimizes deteriorating of the projectile <b>11</b> when the base <b>314</b> pivots about the channel <b>325</b> relative to the projectile <b>11</b>. Also, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 48A</figref>, the projectile support surface <b>360</b> is upwardly sloped along an arc path <b>361</b> on each side as it approaches the respective projectile guide <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>. The arc path <b>361</b> serves as a guide surface configured to reduce or minimize deterioration of the projectile <b>11</b>.<br />(107) In an embodiment, one or more additional cavities or openings <b>354</b> (FIGS. <b>42</b>, <b>44</b> and <b>47</b>B) are formed in the projectile support device <b>300</b> and extend between the front surface <b>344</b> and the rear surface <b>346</b>. The one or more additional openings <b>354</b> may act to improve performance by decreasing air resistance, overall weight, as well as improving stability of the projectile support device <b>300</b>. As shown, the one or more additional openings are positioned between the base <b>314</b> and the projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>, however in other embodiments, the one or more additional openings <b>354</b> may be alternatively positioned relative to the base <b>314</b> and the projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b>. The projectile support device <b>300</b> is further configured to rotate about an axis <b>363</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 42</figref>) that is substantially parallel to the first and second extension planes <b>303</b>, <b>305</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 36A</figref>).<br />(108) During operation, the projectile support device <b>300</b> is in an up position, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 15</figref>. In this up position, the projectile support device <b>300</b> is oriented such that the projectile guide axis PG (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 46</figref>) is substantially upright, substantially vertical or substantially parallel to the bow axis B (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>). The projectile <b>11</b> is positioned such that it lies along the shooting axis S (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>), and a portion of the projectile <b>11</b> rests on the projectile support surface <b>360</b>. During the firing of the projectile <b>11</b> along the shooting axis S, the spring-based mechanism within the housing <b>60</b> of the accessory <b>100</b>, <b>101</b> causes the projectile support device <b>300</b> to pivot or rotate to a down position where the projectile guide axis PG (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 46</figref>) is substantially parallel to the shooting axis S (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>).<br />(109) By moving from the up to the down position, the projectile support device <b>300</b> provides clearance for the projectile <b>11</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, by moving down, the projectile support device <b>300</b> avoids interference with the fletching of an arrow or other type of projectile <b>11</b>. In some embodiments, the projectile support device <b>300</b> may further include a top guide <b>370</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 23 and 31-33</figref>) that extends along a top guide axis TG. The top guide <b>370</b> is configured to prevent the projectile <b>11</b> from jumping from its initial position between the projectile guides <b>340</b>, <b>342</b> to a position outside of the projectile support device <b>300</b>. The top guide <b>370</b> can also assist in aiming or shooting performance.<br />(110) The archery riser and method described above enhance the adjustability of an archery accessory relative to an archery riser while the archery accessory is coupled to the archery riser. Also, the projectile support device described above improves performance, decreases wear of projectiles, and decreases overall weight and manufacturing costs.<br />(111) Additional embodiments include any one of the embodiments described above and described in any and all exhibits and other materials submitted herewith, where one or more of its components, functionalities or structures is interchanged with, replaced by or augmented by one or more of the components, functionalities or structures of a different embodiment described above.<br />(112) The parts, components, and structural elements of mounting portion <b>30</b> can be combined into an integral or unitary, one-piece object, or such parts, components, and structural elements can be distinct, removable items that are attachable to each other through screws, bolts, pins and other suitable fasteners.<br />(113) The parts, components, and structural elements of archery accessory <b>100</b> can be combined into an integral or unitary, one-piece object, or such parts, components, and structural elements can be distinct, removable items that are attachable to each other through screws, bolts, pins and other suitable fasteners.<br />(114) In the foregoing description, certain components or elements may have been described as being configured to mate with each other. For example, an embodiment may be described as a first element (functioning as a male) configured to be inserted into a second element (functioning as a female).

Similar features across different structures have been numbered with a common reference numeral and have been differentiated by an alphabetic suffix. Similar features in a particular structure have been numbered with a common two-digit, base reference numeral and have been differentiated by a different leading numeral. Also, to enhance consistency, the structures in any particular drawing may share the same alphabetic suffix even if a particular feature is shown in less than all structures. Similar features are structured similarly, operate similarly, and/or have the same function unless otherwise indicated by the drawings or this specification. Furthermore, particular features of one structure can replace corresponding features in another structure or can supplement other structures unless otherwise indicated by the drawings or this specification.<br />(16) The present disclosure provides a projectile launching system that includes a projectile launcher and a projectile. Embodiments of the present disclosure can be practiced in revolvers and rifles, for example, for firing bullets. Other embodiments of the present disclosure can be practiced in artillery pieces for firing shells. In at least one exemplary embodiment, a projectile such as a bullet can be made to spin about the axis of its trajectory prior to be being fired from a barrel of a projectile launcher. It is noted that the bullet can be initially positioned in a chamber defined by the barrel. The spinning of the bullet can allow for better gyroscopic stability during travel while concurrently enhancing the transfer of kinetic energy from the bullet to the target over the amount of energy that could be delivered by velocity alone. Imparting spinning before the bullet passes though the barrel can also enhance the amount of energy possessed by the projectile upon leaving the barrel, as energy is lost in existing systems because of friction between the barrel and the bullet to create spinning through rifling.<br />(17) In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the pre-firing spinning can be accomplished by spinning the barrel in which the bullet is positioned. A spinning barrel can hold, aim and impart rotational energy to the bullet. A revolver <b>10</b> incorporating an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure is disclosed in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>. It is noted that, while a revolver is chosen as an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, any structure configured to launch/fire a projectile is contemplated as an operating environment for one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. The revolver <b>10</b> is an exemplary projectile launcher and includes a barrel <b>12</b>. The exemplary barrel <b>12</b> extends along a longitudinal axis <b>26</b> between a first end <b>62</b> and a second end <b>64</b>. The second end <b>66</b> defines an exit port of the barrel <b>12</b>. A bullet <b>14</b> is an exemplary projectile and is positioned in the barrel <b>12</b>. The exemplary projectile <b>14</b> is positioned in the exemplary barrel <b>12</b> closer to the first end <b>62</b>.<br />(18) The exemplary revolver <b>10</b> also includes firing pin mechanism, shown schematically and referenced at <b>16</b>. The exemplary firing pin mechanism <b>16</b> is positioned at the first end <b>62</b> and configured to, at least partially, selectively project into the exemplary barrel <b>12</b> and engage the primer of the projectile <b>14</b>. When the firing pin mechanism <b>16</b> projects into the exemplary barrel <b>12</b> and engage the primer of the projectile <b>14</b>, a quantity of propellant of the projectile <b>14</b> is ignited and the projectile <b>14</b> is launched through and out of the exemplary barrel <b>12</b>.<br />(19) The exemplary revolver <b>10</b> also includes a trigger <b>18</b> that can be engaged by a human user to activate the firing pin mechanism <b>16</b>. The trigger <b>18</b> is an exemplary activator engaged with the firing pin mechanism <b>16</b> and engageable by a user of the projectile launcher <b>10</b> to control the firing pin mechanism <b>16</b> to project into the barrel <b>12</b> and engage the primer of a projectile positioned in the barrel <b>12</b>. In other embodiments of projectile launcher contemplated by the present disclosure, an activator can be a button, a touch screen display or any other structure that can be accessed by a human operator to initiate launching of a projectile.<br />(20) The exemplary revolver <b>10</b> also includes a power system configured to rotate the barrel <b>12</b>. The power system is shown schematically and referenced at <b>20</b>. The power system <b>20</b> is configured to rotate the barrel <b>12</b> about the axis <b>26</b>. Spinning of the barrel <b>12</b> can be transmitted to the bullet <b>14</b> through minimal friction contact between the outside of the bullet <b>14</b> and the inside of the barrel <b>12</b>. The exemplary axis <b>26</b> is also the trajectory of the bullet <b>14</b> and rotation of the barrel <b>12</b> and the bullet <b>14</b> is referenced at <b>28</b>. The power system <b>20</b> is configured to be rotating the barrel <b>12</b> as the firing pin mechanism <b>16</b> is projecting into the barrel <b>12</b> and engaging the primer of the projectile <b>14</b>. In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, engagement between the bullet <b>14</b> and the barrel <b>12</b> can be enhanced to promote concurrent rotation by forming complimentary grooves and fins between the external circumference of the bullet <b>14</b> and the internal circumference of the barrel <b>12</b>.<br />(21) The power system <b>20</b> is configured to achieve rapid rotation of the barrel <b>12</b> through any one of electromagnetic, chemical, mechanical or other source of energy. For example, an electromagnetic version of the power system <b>20</b> can apply principles of electric motors to spin the barrel <b>12</b>. In another example, a chemical version of the power system <b>20</b> can harness the expansion of gases and apply the gases to fins formed on the barrel <b>12</b>, such as in a turbine engine. In another example, a mechanical version of the power system <b>20</b> can apply gearing or belts or direct contact between a driving roller and the barrel <b>12</b>. Certainly, more kinds of power systems become available as the size of an embodiment increases.<br />(22) The exemplary revolver <b>10</b> also includes an external protective covering <b>22</b> to allow the barrel <b>12</b> to rotate without injury to a human operator. The exemplary revolver <b>10</b> also includes a cooling system to cool components of the power system <b>20</b>. The cooling system is shown schematically and referenced at <b>24</b>.<br />(23) In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the barrel <b>12</b> can remain stationary and the bullet <b>14</b> can be spun within the barrel <b>12</b>. In such embodiments, a portion of the bullet <b>14</b> could extend out of a rear of the barrel <b>12</b> and be acted upon by a mechanical or chemical version of the power system <b>20</b>. In other embodiments in which an electromagnetic version of the power system <b>20</b> is applied, the bullet <b>14</b> could be acted upon while fully contained within the barrel <b>12</b>.<br />(24) In various embodiments in which the bullet <b>14</b> spins relative to the barrel <b>12</b>, friction between the bullet <b>14</b> and the barrel <b>12</b> can be reduced to inhibit heat generation by creating a vacuum between the bullet <b>14</b> and the barrel <b>12</b>. Such a vacuum can be maintained until the bullet <b>14</b> is fired. One or more embodiments can also be practiced wherein friction between the bullet <b>14</b> and the barrel <b>12</b> can be reduced by forming the barrel <b>12</b>, the bullet <b>14</b>, or both to include a friction-reducing coating. In one example, the bullet <b>14</b> can include the coating and the coating can be sacrificial, melting during firing to form a protective layer between the bullet <b>14</b> and the barrel <b>12</b> during spinning as the bullet <b>14</b> achieves its maximum rate of rotation.<br />(25) In one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, if the application of rotational force on the barrel <b>12</b> generates a reaction force or moment, an arrangement of springs can be positioned between the barrel <b>12</b> and the cover <b>22</b> to inhibit the reaction force from disturbing the aim and alignment of the barrel <b>12</b> as desired by the user. In one or more other embodiments of the present disclosure, the revolver <b>10</b> can include two barrels. For example, <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front view of a revolver <b>10</b><i>a </i>with a barrels <b>12</b><i>a </i>and <b>112</b><i>a</i>. The exemplary barrels <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>a </i>are aligned as an adjacent pair, like the barrels of a double-barreled shotgun. The respective directions of spin of the barrels <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>112</b><i>a </i>are opposite so that there is no net tendency for the revolver <b>10</b><i>a </i>to spin or lurch. The exemplary barrel <b>12</b><i>a </i>spins in a first rotational direction <b>28</b><i>a </i>about an axis <b>26</b><i>a</i>. The exemplary barrel <b>112</b><i>a </i>spins in a second rotational direction <b>128</b><i>a </i>about an axis <b>126</b><i>a</i>. The first rotational direction <b>28</b><i>a </i>is opposite to the second rotational direction <b>128</b><i>a. </i><br />(26) In another aspect of the present disclosure, an improved projectile is provided. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of one-half of a bullet or projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>according to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>is an exemplary projectile and extends along a central, projectile longitudinal axis <b>30</b><i>c</i>. The central longitudinal axis <b>30</b><i>c </i>of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>is in the plane of view of <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>. It is noted that <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> shows a “top half” of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>and a “bottom half” would be a mirror image of the top half.<br />(27) The exemplary projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes several components which are held together during flight despite the centrifugal force created by rapid spinning. The exemplary projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes primer <b>66</b><i>c</i>, a quantity of propellant <b>68</b><i>c</i>, and at least one sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The exemplary projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes a central, roughly cylindrical rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>serving as a core of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c</i>. The rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>extends from a forward end or leading tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>to an aft end or base <b>36</b><i>c </i>of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c</i>. Electromagnetic forces applied to rotate the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can be acting on the rod <b>32</b><i>c</i>. Radiating flanges, such as flange <b>38</b><i>c</i>, extend radially outwardly from the base <b>36</b><i>c </i>and at an intermediate region between the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>and the base <b>36</b><i>c</i>. The exemplary flange <b>38</b><i>c </i>projects away from the rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>transverse to the projectile longitudinal axis <b>30</b><i>c </i>at the aft end <b>36</b><i>c</i>. The sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>abuts the flange <b>38</b><i>c </i>and the rod <b>32</b><i>c</i>. It is noted that the flanges <b>38</b><i>c </i>can be formed to extend radially beyond a remainder of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c</i>. Such flanges <b>38</b><i>c </i>could act as fins of appropriate size and shape, to enhance rotation of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>and minimize the air resistance acting on the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>so that the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can maintain a maximum forward velocity and travel longer distances. It is noted that, in one or more projectiles according to the present disclosure, subcomponents within a projectile can be interconnected with circumferential springs or wire so that the subcomponents separate in response to a predetermined level of centrifugal force.<br />(28) The exemplary projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes a peripheral outer shell formed from a plurality of shrapnel pieces or sub-projectiles. An exemplary sub-projectile is referenced at <b>40</b><i>c</i>. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref> is an isometric view of the exemplary sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The exemplary sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>includes a forward face <b>42</b><i>c</i>, an aft face <b>44</b><i>c</i>, a radially inner face <b>46</b><i>c</i>, and a radially outer face <b>48</b><i>c</i>. A lateral side of the sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>is referenced at <b>50</b><i>c. </i><br />(29) The sub-projectiles can be interlocked with one another and/or with the flanges <b>38</b><i>c </i>so that the sub-projectiles spin together. The sub-projectiles can be shaped as desired and held together by interdigitations and/or other connections to the flanges <b>38</b><i>c </i>at the base <b>36</b><i>c</i>. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> shows that a layer <b>52</b><i>c </i>of material can cover the sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c</i>. The layer <b>52</b><i>c </i>can be anti-friction material or a warfare agent such as an incendiary (flammable), chemical warfare or radioactive material.<br />(30) The projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can be constructed so that the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>of the rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>is the first point of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>to strike the target. The stopping/slowing force acting on the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>at impact with the target can cause the interdigitated outer sub-projectiles, such as piece <b>40</b><i>c</i>, to no longer be constrained to move together. Each piece can be directed forward by momentum and outwards from the trajectory, in a direction between the trajectory of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>and a plane perpendicular to it. Thus, energy associated with the spin of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>as well as energy associated with rectilinear forward motion of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can be utilized to damage the target.<br />(31) In the exemplary embodiment, the disassembly of the outer shell of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can be achieved by the forward momentum of the sub-projectiles. In the exemplary embodiment, the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>includes forward portions, such as a forward portion referenced at <b>54</b><i>c</i>. The forward portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>can be integrally-formed with the rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>or separately-formed and fixed to the rod <b>32</b><i>c</i>. The rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>and the forward portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>can remain connected when the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>initially strikes the target. The forward portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>defines a rearwardly-facing ramp face <b>56</b><i>c</i>. The forward face <b>42</b><i>c </i>extends flush on the ramp face <b>56</b><i>c</i>. The exemplary sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>and the exemplary forward portion <b>54</b><i>c </i>are not fixed together. When the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>strikes the target, the forward face <b>42</b><i>c </i>of the sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>rides up the ramp face <b>56</b><i>c</i>, causing uncoupling of the sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>from the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>and movement of the sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>c </i>at the angle of the ramp face <b>40</b><i>c </i>relative to the axis <b>30</b><i>c. </i><br />(32) Separation of the sub-projectiles can be accomplished in other ways in other embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, explosive charges can be positioned inside the rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>and be arranged to detonate when the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>strikes the target. In other embodiments, the base <b>36</b><i>c </i>can be configures to fragment when the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>strikes the target. Dispersion of the portions of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can also be enhanced by varying the density of the sub-projectiles. As the rate of rotation decreases when the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>strikes the target, denser sub-projectiles can move relative to less dense sub-projectiles because of the differences in angular momentum, causing unlocking of tessellations that interconnect the sub-projectiles.<br />(33) In another aspect of the present disclosure, the rod <b>32</b><i>c </i>can be hollow and contain a molten fluid that is released gradually during the flight of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>because of the centrifugal spin of the projectile <b>14</b><i>c</i>. The fluid can serve any desired purpose. For example, the fluid can minimize air resistance. Alternatively, the projectile <b>14</b><i>c </i>can be configured so that the fluid is released only when spin velocity decreases below some predetermined threshold. In such an embodiment, the fluid can be a warfare agent such as an incendiary, chemical or radioactive material.<br />(34) In another aspect of the present disclosure, in one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, a cross sectional shape of the barrel can change as the rotational speed of the barrel is increased to a maximum spin velocity. This can be accomplished by forming circumferential portions of the barrel with different materials having different densities. In such embodiments, the cross-sectional shape of the barrel can change to a circular cross section from an ovoid cross section. This change would allow the bullet to fire and pass through the barrel when sufficient pressure behind the bullet and sufficient spin velocity of the barrel has been achieved. A bullet used with such a barrel can also be configured to change its cross-sectional shape while attaining maximum spin velocity by virtue of different density of material along its circumference. A cross-sectional shape of such a bullet could change into a circular cross section from an ovoid cross section, allowing the bullet to fire and pass through the barrel when sufficient pressure behind the bullet and sufficient spin velocity is achieved. Such a bullet could also change shape during travel, returning to an ovoid cross section during flight as spin velocity decreases to release its shell shrapnel components (sub-projectiles) in a centrifugal direction when the velocity is decreased by air friction or impact with its target.<br />(35) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref> is a side view of a bullet <b>14</b><i>d </i>according to another exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure. The exemplary bullet <b>14</b><i>d </i>includes several components which are held together during flight despite the centrifugal force created by rapid spinning. The exemplary bullet <b>14</b><i>d </i>includes a central, roughly cylindrical rod <b>32</b><i>d </i>serving as a core of the bullet <b>14</b><i>d</i>. The rod <b>32</b><i>d </i>extends from a leading tip <b>34</b><i>d </i>of the bullet <b>14</b><i>d </i>to a base <b>36</b><i>d </i>of the bullet <b>14</b><i>d</i>. A circumferential, cup-like flange <b>38</b><i>d </i>extends radially outwardly from the base <b>36</b><i>d. </i><br />(36) The exemplary bullet <b>14</b><i>d </i>includes a peripheral outer shell formed from a plurality of sub-projectiles <b>40</b><i>d</i>, <b>140</b><i>d</i>, <b>240</b><i>d</i>, <b>340</b><i>d</i>. The exemplary sub-projectiles <b>40</b><i>d</i>, <b>140</b><i>d</i>, <b>240</b><i>d</i>, <b>340</b><i>d </i>are interlocked with one another with tongue and groove structures. For example, the sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>d </i>includes a tongue <b>58</b><i>d </i>that is received in groove <b>260</b><i>d </i>of the sub-projectile <b>240</b><i>d</i>. The sub-projectile <b>40</b><i>d </i>also includes a groove <b>60</b><i>d </i>that receives a tongue <b>158</b><i>d </i>of the sub-projectile <b>140</b><i>d. </i><br />(37) In the exemplary bullet <b>14</b><i>d</i>, the cross-section of the interlocking pattern of tongues and grooves changes gradually between the base <b>36</b><i>d </i>and the tip <b>34</b><i>d</i>. At the loss of the retaining cup-like flange <b>38</b><i>d </i>that is initiated by the tip <b>34</b><i>c </i>striking a target, centrifugal forces cause separation of the sub-projectiles. The separation starts at the base <b>36</b><i>d </i>and continues toward the tip <b>34</b><i>c. </i><br />(38) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 8-9</figref> relate to a projectile <b>14</b><i>b </i>containing rotating interconnected shrapnel (sub-projectiles) which can expand to form a spinning net when cohesion of the shrapnel pieces is overcome by centrifugal force. An outer jacket of the projectile <b>14</b><i>b </i>is referenced at <b>70</b><i>b</i>. The projectile <b>14</b><i>b </i>includes sub-projectiles in the form of a plurality of rods <b>72</b><i>b</i>. The projectile <b>14</b><i>b </i>also includes wires interconnecting the rods <b>72</b><i>b</i>, referenced at <b>74</b><i>b</i>. It is noted that the primer and propellant is not shown, but are components of the projectile <b>14</b><i>b. </i><br />(39) Upon launching of the projectile <b>14</b><i>b</i>, cohesion of the rods <b>72</b><i>b </i>is overcome by centrifugal force and the projectile <b>14</b><i>b </i>morphs into a spinning net. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 10-13</figref> show various patterns of spinning nets that can be formed after expansion of the rods <b>72</b><i>b </i>while still held together by interconnecting wires <b>74</b><i>b</i>. The projectile <b>14</b><i>b </i>may be useful in increasingly effective diameter of the projectile at a distance and compensate for decreases in accuracy over distance. This embodiment may also be useful for combating airborne targets such as missiles or grounds and in some embodiments may be modified to be sublethal incapacitating devices.<br />(40) While the present disclosure has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the present disclosure without departing from the essential scope thereof.

Student desks <b>12</b> vary in size and shape, but all have a desk top. The student desk <b>12</b> has a frame <b>14</b>. The student desk <b>12</b> will sometimes have an attached seat <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. Some student desks <b>12</b> have a separate seat <b>16</b> but the embodiment shown herein uses an integral seat. It is contemplated that the ballistic desk top <b>10</b> is used with a standalone desk and separate chair (not shown). In any case, the frame <b>14</b> supports the desk top <b>10</b>.<br />(10) The ballistic desk top <b>10</b> is made from layers of different ballistic materials that are all adhered together to form a laminated ballistic structure. The desk top <b>10</b>, as shown in the FIGS, is a mostly planar structure, but it is contemplated it includes other features, such as a curved lip, surface contours, or other shape. The desk top <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref> has a leading edge <b>21</b> that is obliquely angled with respect to the bottom surface <b>29</b>. A corner <b>23</b> connects the top surface <b>28</b> to the leading edge <b>21</b>. In this configuration, it provides additional deflection and thickness near the floor for when bullets are fired near the floor or from a ricochet. Opposite the leading edge <b>21</b> is a student-facing edge <b>25</b>, which is shown as perpendicular to the top and bottom surfaces <b>28</b>, <b>29</b>. The desk top <b>10</b> may include other commonly used desktop features, such as grooves that serve as pencil holders or inset trays for assorted items. The desk top <b>10</b> has a bottom layer <b>30</b> made from a ballistic material, such as ¾″ bullet resistant Lexan or ballistic polycarbonate. A layer of woven fabric <b>32</b> (commonly aramid fibers, Kevlar, or equivalent thereto) is adhered to the bottom layer <b>30</b>. The fabric layer <b>32</b> can be printed with a school logo, artistic design, instructions, or anything else that the manufacturer desires. It is contemplated that the fabric layer <b>32</b> is unprinted and left its natural color. The fabric layer <b>32</b> is commonly adhered to the bottom layer <b>30</b> through epoxy. Overlaying and bonded to the fabric layer <b>32</b> is a top layer <b>34</b> of ballistic material, such as 7/16″ bullet resistant Lexan or ballistic polycarbonate. The top layer <b>34</b> is adhered to the fabric layer <b>32</b> through epoxy. It is contemplated that instead of epoxy, another method of joining the layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is used, such as fusing with methylene chloride or sonic welding. It is further contemplated that the fabric layer <b>32</b> is integrally formed inside a single sheet of ballistic polycarbonate during extrusion. The polycarbonate layers <b>30</b>, <b>34</b> cooperate with the fabric layer <b>32</b> to slow and/or stop any projectiles, bullets, shrapnel, or other high-velocity object. The projectile would impact the top layer <b>34</b> first and either be deflected or proceed through the thickness toward the fabric layer <b>32</b>. If the projectile makes it through the top layer <b>34</b>, the fabric layer <b>32</b> provides a tear and puncture-resistant layer. If the projectile has enough energy to penetrate the top layer <b>34</b> and fabric layer <b>32</b>, the bottom layer <b>30</b> provides the last layer of protection. As shown, it is thicker than the top layer <b>34</b>. If the projectile has enough energy to penetrate the bottom layer <b>30</b>, a significant portion of the energy from it will be absorbed by the desk top <b>10</b>.<br />(11) The frame <b>14</b> is commonly made from a series of elongate solid or tubular members that are welded or otherwise affixed to each other for strength and rigidity. The frame <b>14</b> has feet <b>50</b> for contacting the ground with front and rear upstanding members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> that extend upwardly from the feet <b>50</b>. Opposite the feet <b>50</b> are top members <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> that provide direct support for the desk top <b>10</b>. The top members <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> may interconnect between the upstanding members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b>. Some frame styles interconnect between the upstanding members at the bottom, near the feet <b>50</b>. Other frame styles, sometimes called a “sled” frame, interconnect the upstanding members <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> with parallel members that act as the foot to contact the floor. Depending on the style of frame <b>14</b>, the rear upstanding members <b>52</b> may be angled, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>. In any frame configuration, the desk top <b>10</b> may be adapted to be connected thereto by locating mounting points as described below.<br />(12) The bottom side of the desk top <b>10</b> has several components and features that allow it to be attached to the frame <b>14</b>. The attachment occurs commonly at the top members <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>. The desk top <b>10</b> also includes handles <b>22</b> that allows it to be held, handled, and moved around when separated from the frame <b>14</b>. The handles <b>22</b> are secured to the desk top <b>10</b> through fasteners. The fasteners are either threaded or embedded into the desk top <b>10</b> or they are bolted through the thicknesses of the layers <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>. In this case, the heads of the fasteners would be countersunk or otherwise flush with the desk top surface <b>28</b>. Otherwise, the fasteners would interfere with normal writing and desk functions. Quick releases <b>24</b> and hooks <b>26</b> are securely attached to the desk top <b>10</b>, commonly through fasteners that are either threaded into or embedded in the desk top <b>10</b>.<br />(13) The quick release <b>24</b> is unlatched from the frame <b>14</b> using only a sharp upward press or movement from the user on the bottom surface <b>29</b>. Because an active shooter situation involves adrenaline and time is of the essence, the quick release <b>24</b> is a “C” shaped deformable catch that partially encircles the frame <b>14</b> with arcuate portions. No release handles, levers, or moving parts are required to disconnect the top <b>10</b> from the frame <b>14</b>. A section view is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref> of the quick release <b>24</b> attached to the frame <b>14</b>. A sharp upward movement disengages the quick release <b>24</b> from the frame <b>14</b>. As shown, the hook <b>26</b> is one-sided and allows the student or user to pull the top <b>10</b> towards themselves and upward to decouple the hook from the frame <b>14</b>. It is contemplated that other release and catch mechanisms are used. A strap <b>40</b> provides an additional method to carry or hold the desk top <b>10</b> by the user. The strap <b>40</b> may be attached and configured to be worn like a backpack strap, cross-body strap, or flexible handle.<br />(14) To reconnect the desk top <b>10</b> to the frame, the hooks <b>26</b> are located to the frame <b>14</b> (top member <b>56</b> in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref>) and the quick release <b>24</b> is aligned over the top member <b>58</b>. A downward press on the top surface <b>28</b> snaps the quick release <b>24</b> over the top member. No tools, locks, or keys are necessary.<br />(15) It is understood that while certain aspects of the disclosed subject matter have been shown and described, the disclosed subject matter is not limited thereto and encompasses various other embodiments and aspects.

These basic firing parameters are shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>. According to the invention, the aiming device comprises a clinometer and a computer comprising the ballistics chart for the munition in question. To determine the firing conditions, the user <b>1</b> first determines the sight line <b>4</b>. In the case in which the sight line <b>4</b> is not horizontal, the firer must mark (or lock) this sight line <b>4</b>. It may be marked in various ways, such as by pressing a button, by holding this sight line for a given time, or by any other means (voice command, blinking an eye, etc.) allowing the system to decide that it does indeed signify the designation of a target.<br />[0070] The elevation of this sight line is then memorized by the computer. A display <b>10</b>, <b>21</b> then initially indicates a range of zero to the user. During the marking operation, an indicator light may advantageously switch from an off state <b>9</b> signifying that the sight line has not been locked to an on state <b>12</b> indicating that the sight line has been locked.<br />[0071] Once this sight line has been locked, the firer simply has to increase the angle of elevation of the firearm until the displayed distance <b>11</b>, <b>22</b> corresponds to the distance from the target. The general principle of this firing mode is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>.<br />[0072] During this vertical movement, a change in the azimuthal direction of the firearm <b>5</b> by the firer should be avoided. The simplest way to achieve this is to use a point of reference such as a vertical reticle projected to infinity by a suitable device and superposed visually over the target, such as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>.<br />[0073] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> shows the simplest mode of implementation of the invention, having the advantage of using no moving parts. In <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2<i>a</i></figref>, the user designates the target by means of a fixed reticle <b>28</b> and marks the target. The indicated distance <b>10</b> is then 0 and the indicator light <b>9</b> is initially off. Next, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2<i>b</i></figref>, the user locks the sight line and raises the firearm while keeping the target in the vertical fixed reticle <b>20</b> until the predetermined distance is displayed.<br />[0074] The display from <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> may for example be provided by the device from <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>. In this figure, a display device <b>30</b> is placed at the focal point of a lens <b>31</b>, and the image of the screen <b>30</b> at infinity is redirected via a fixed redirecting mirror <b>32</b> to a semireflective device <b>34</b> allowing the image of the screen to be superposed over the image of the target in the sight of the user <b>1</b>. The semireflective device may for example comprise a simple semireflective plate, a prism, or a cube formed of two prisms and comprising a semireflective diagonal.<br />[0075] In this embodiment, the visual field over which the display is superposed must be large enough to keep the display of the distance <b>11</b> and the vertical reticle <b>30</b> visible and superposed over the target <b>2</b> regardless of the elevation.<br />[0076] The screen may for example comprise a simple LED display such as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>, a vertical linear LED for visually representing the vertical reticle <b>20</b> and a horizontal LED forming, with the vertical LED, the reticle <b>28</b>. Alternatively, the display device <b>30</b> comprises a small, high-resolution matrix display in order to limit the bulk of the device. Such a system affords the display greater flexibility, but generally has the drawback of increased energy consumption. The computer must also, in this case, comprise more sophisticated graphics means (GPU).<br />[0077] According to a more sophisticated embodiment of the invention as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref>, when raising the firearm after lock, the designation reticle <b>8</b> tracks the aiming line by means of a tracking device, the computer moving the reticle <b>8</b> vertically in real time so as to track the target on the sight line. The display of the distance may (as in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4<i>b</i></figref>) or may not track an equivalent movement in the visual field. In this case, once in firing position, the firer aligns the reticle with the target until the displayed distance is suitable for the firer. In practice, the position of the reticle is controlled and stabilized by means of a PID controller, for example, so that it is kept aligned with the firing line defined by the firer at the start.<br />[0078] In this case, the tracking may also be provided by the device from <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>. It is then sufficient to move the representation of the reticle <b>41</b> over the display device <b>30</b>. For example, it may be moved simply by moving the image of the reticle over the high-resolution matrix display such as described above. This movement is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>.<br />[0079] Preferably, the tracking device, such as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, comprises a movable redirecting mirror <b>50</b> rotating about a horizontal axis <b>51</b> allowing the sighting angle of the display to be adjusted.<br />[0080] Regardless of whether the redirecting mirror is fixed or movable, the semitransparent device allowing the reticle and the display to be superposed over the target may advantageously comprise a splitter cube <b>52</b> comprising two prisms separated by a splitter plate <b>53</b>. This type of cube is used both to improve the robustness of the superposing plate and to decrease the bulk of the system. Specifically, refractions of the projected image of the screen at the entrance and at the exit of the prism have the effect of decreasing the movement of the corresponding light beams over the splitter plate <b>53</b>, thus decreasing the required length of the splitter plate <b>53</b>. The second prism, on the target side, allows the chromatic distortions of the image of the target caused by refraction to be removed.<br />[0081] Advantageously, the device of the invention may be incorporated within a target magnification device such as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. In this case, the system advantageously comprises a tracking mirror <b>60</b> that is able to rotate about a horizontal axis, redirecting the sight axis <b>4</b> onto the optical axis <b>64</b> of an objective lens <b>61</b>, the computer comprising means for controlling the rotation of the tracking mirror <b>60</b> that are arranged to keep, once the elevation has been locked, the aiming axis <b>4</b> redirected onto the optical axis <b>64</b> of the objective lens <b>61</b>.<br />[0082] In this case, the display device may advantageously be placed behind a semitransparent plate <b>62</b> that redirects the optical axis <b>64</b> from the objective lens <b>61</b> onto an eyepiece lens <b>63</b>, the display screen <b>30</b> being placed in a conjugate plane of the focal plane of the eyepiece lens <b>63</b> so as to project the image of the screen <b>30</b> to infinity.<br />[0083] Advantageously, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 10</figref>, an illuminator/pointer <b>65</b> may be placed in the extension of the optical axis <b>64</b> of the objective lens <b>61</b>, and at the focal point thereof so as to illuminate the target <b>2</b>.<br />[0084] Conventionally, the eyepiece lens <b>63</b> is a divergent lens, forming what is termed a Galilean scope geometry with the objective lens, allowing an upright image to be formed. Of course, the term “eyepiece lens” is understood to mean a simple divergent lens, or an assembly of achromatic lenses such as an achromatic doublet or triplet, well known to those skilled in the art.<br />[0085] Alternatively, the eyepiece <b>63</b> may be a convergent lens forming what is termed a Keplerian geometry with the objective lens. In this case, a device for rectifying the image is generally used. This type of geometry makes it possible to place a fixed (passive) reticule at the focal point of the objective lens and a passive LCD digital display, thereby allowing the consumption of the device to be decreased.<br />[0086] When magnification is used, it may be desirable to keep the gaze of the user on the axis of the sight line <b>4</b> rather than along the aiming axis <b>13</b>. In this case, two additional redirecting mirrors are used, the mirror redirecting to the user being movable and slaved to the tracking mirror <b>60</b>, these two mirrors being arranged to keep an angle of 90° between them.<br />[0087] An exemplary embodiment of such a device is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref>. In this device, the abovementioned slaving of the mirror redirecting to the user to the tracking mirror is provided by using two faces of one and the same reflective prism <b>70</b>. When the device is locked onto the elevation of the sight line, the angle of elevation is tracked by rotating the prism <b>70</b> on its axis <b>75</b>. When the angle of elevation increases by a value α, the prism rotates by α/<b>2</b>. The image of the target is next reflected toward the objective lens <b>61</b> and then successively redirected by the mirrors <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>73</b>, <b>74</b>, one of these being semitransparent so as to superpose the display of the screen <b>30</b> located in a conjugate plane of the focal plane of the eyepiece lens <b>63</b>. The advantage of the geometry presented in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref> is that it provides minimal bulk.<br />[0088] Advantageously, the device of the invention comprises a low-pass frequency filter allowing the noise caused by involuntary small movements of the firer (parasitic vibrations) to be decreased so that they do not affect the readability of the displayed distance.<br />[0089] One advantage of the invention is that it makes it possible not to have to manually enter the distance into the aiming system. It also makes it possible to benefit from the possibility of using different ballistics charts according to the projectile being used without modifying hardware, unlike in mechanical aiming systems.<br />[0090] Advantageously, the device of the invention also comprises means for applying an azimuthal correction for the Magnus effect. For example, the movable reticle or the vertical reticle may be moved laterally according to the calculated distance.<br />[0091] Alternatively, the Magnus effect may be corrected for by modifying the cant angle. In this case, the device of the invention comprises a clinometer measuring the cant angle, the computer determining, as a function of the displayed range, the ideal cant angle (i.e. that correcting for the Magnus effect). The display then comprises an indicator indicating to the firer whether or not the tilt is adequate. For example, the display comprises two indicator lights indicating in which direction the user should increase the cant angle, these indicator lights turning off to indicate an adequate angle."

The concealed holster 1 is designed to conceal a pistol and is typically constructed of leather, plastic or other resilient material and includes a downwardly-extending, shaped holster pocket 2, typically having a pocket break 2a in the rear surface, or pocket back 6. The holster pocket 2 is further characterized by pocket sides 3, joined by a pocket front 4 and the pocket back 6 and terminating at a pocket bottom 5, as illustrated. A grip receiver 7 extends from the top of the holster pocket 2 and may be constructed in one piece with the holster pocket 2 or connected to the holster pocket 2 by glue, brads or other fasteners, as desired. The grip receiver 7 is further characterized by grip receiver sides 8, which are typically substantially coterminous with the pocket front 4 and the pocket back 6, respectively, of the holster pocket 2 and the grip receiver 7 includes a downwardly-tapered grip receiver top 9 that spans the top of the grip receiver sides 8, as further illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 3 of the drawings. A typically resilient grip receiver face 10 is provided in the inside face of the grip receiver 7 and is bounded by the grip receiver sides 8 and the grip receiver top 9, as further illustrated in FIG. 3 of the drawings. A face inlay 11 is provided in the grip receiver face 10 and is shaped to receive the pistol grip 27 and action 28 of an automatic pistol 26, as further illustrated in FIG. 3. Accordingly, it will be appreciated that the pistol grip 27 and the action 28 of the pistol 26 are recessed in the face inlay 11 of the resilient, typically expanded foam grip receiver face 10, when the concealed holster 1 is positioned in functional configuration illustrated in FIG. 3, for the purpose hereinafter described.<br />[0016] Referring now to FIGS. 1 and 5-8 of the drawings a pivot, tilt or hinge line 12 is defined by the resilient (typically leather or plastic) case bottom 16 of an auxiliary case 13 and the top edge of the belt 20. The auxiliary case 13 is attached to the grip receiver 7 by glue, brads or other fasteners, and may also be similarly attached to the holster pocket 2, to facilitate pivoting, bending and/or tilting of the case bottom 16 of the auxiliary case 13 and the grip receiver 7 in concert along the hinge line 12 at the belt 20, upon reaching for and grasping the pistol 26, as hereinafter further described. The auxiliary case 13 is further typically defined by case sides 14, a case front 15 and a case flap 17 that extends over the top of the auxiliary case 13 to define a flap hinge and is typically releasably attached to the case front 15 by means of a flap closure 18, such as a snap or the like.<br />[0017] As further illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 of the drawings, in a preferred embodiment of the invention the holster pocket 2 of the concealed holster 1 is attached to the belt 20 by means of a belt clip 21, having spaced-apart belt legs 22 that extend from a pocket mount 24, mounted by any suitable means on the pocket side 3 of the holster pocket 2, across the top and downwardly across the outside face of the belt 20. The belt clip 21 is further characterized by a pocket leg 23 that also extends from the pocket mount 24 on the holster pocket 2 and projects around the bottom of the belt 20 and upwardly between the belt legs 22, as illustrated in FIG. 2 of the drawings, to removably mount the concealed holster 1 on the belt 20.<br />[0018] In operation and referring now to FIGS. 3 and 8-11 of the drawings, in FIG. 8 the concealed holster 1 is illustrated in mounted position on the belt 20 of a user, with the pistol 26 in concealed configuration and the holster pocket 2 extended and concealed between the slacks 25 and the torso of the user, with the auxiliary case 13 and grip receiver 7 protruding above the belt 20. As described above, the holster pocket 2 is typically connected to the belt clip 21 and the belt clip 21, to the belt 20. The user's hand is illustrated in functional configuration moving downwardly as indicated by the arrow, to position the fingers between the grip receiver 7 and the user's side, with the knuckles located adjacent to the grip receiver face 10, illustrated in FIG. 3. As illustrated in FIG. 9 the hand is further extended downwardly to project the fingers between the grip receiver 7 and the user's side or torso and force the grip receiver 7 and the auxiliary case 13 in concert outwardly in the direction of the arrow, as the user's hand grasps the pistol grip 27 and the auxiliary case 13 bends, pivots and/or tilts along the hinge line 12 (FIG. 8). This movement facilitates gripping of the pistol grip 27 and removal of the pistol grip 27 and the action 28 from the face inlay 11 of the grip receiver face 10, as the grip receiver 7 and auxiliary case 13 are pivoted or otherwise deflected further outwardly along the hinge line 12, further illustrated in FIG. 8. The user's arm is now ready to move upwardly and draw the pistol 26 from the holster pocket 2 of the concealed holster 1. As illustrated in FIG. 10 of the drawings, the pistol 26 is substantially retrieved from the concealed holster 1, with the barrel 29 extended from the holster pocket 2 and the grip receiver 7 and auxiliary case 13 further pivoted or deflected outwardly above the belt 20, as indicated by the arrow, to facilitate upward movement of the user's arm and allow complete, full and rapid clearance of the pistol 26 from the concealed holster 1. FIG. 11 further illustrates complete removal of the pistol 26 from the concealed holster 1 with the grip receiver 7 and auxiliary case 13 returned to substantially the same configuration illustrated in FIG. 8 on the hinge line 12, as a result of the &quot;memory&quot; in the resilient auxiliary case 13.<br />[0019] It will be appreciated from a consideration of the drawings and the above description that the concealed holster of this invention is designed for use under circumstances where it is desired to conceal a weapon such as a handgun of any design, the automatic pistol 26 being shown in the drawings for illustrative purposes only. It will be further understood, that depending upon the design of the weapon to be concealed, including a knife, &quot;stun gun&quot;, automatic pistol or revolver or other weapon, the holster pocket 2, face inlay 11 and grip receiver 7 can be shaped to accommodate any such weapon, as desired. Furthermore, as illustrated in FIG. 8 of the drawings, under circumstances where the concealed holster 1 is positioned in weapon-concealed configuration, only the auxiliary case 13, the grip receiver sides 8 and the grip receiver top 9 are presented in full view of an observer and since the pistol grip 27 and action 28 illustrated in the drawings are recessed in the face inlay 11 of the grip receiver face 10, the pistol grip 27 and action 28 are not visible. The holster pocket 2, containing the barrel 29 of the pistol 26, is also concealed, as it is extended downwardly between the slacks 25 and the torso of a user, to completely conceal the pistol 26 inside the holster pocket 2 and the grip receiver 7. Accordingly, the concealed holster 1 of this invention features three-dimensional concealment of a weapon, with quick access to the weapon, without the necessity of wearing additional concealment devices, including clothing.<br />[0020] Furthermore, the auxiliary case 13 can be utilized to contain a cellular telephone or a radio, pager, compact disc player or the like (not illustrated) or can remain empty, to simulate such containment, as desired. Moreover, the size and shape of the auxiliary case 13 can be varied as desired, to further enhance concealment of the desired weapon. It will be further understood by those skilled in the art that the holster pocket 2 can be shaped and sized as desired to contain a weapon such as a knife having a blade of selected length, a &quot;stun gun&quot; or a pistol 26 having a desired barrel length and design, for example, a revolver having a longer or shorter barrel than the pistol 26 illustrated in the drawings. The holster pocket 2, grip receiver 7 and/or the auxiliary case 13 can also be typically constructed of leather or other resilient material such as plastic and the like, in non-exclusive particular, according to the weapon size, shape and design and the desires of the manufacturer and the user.<br />[0021] While the preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it will be recognized and understood that various modifications may be made in the invention and the appended claims are intended to cover all such modifications which may fall within the spirit and scope of the invention."

The following will then provide an introduction to the methods and apparatus for embossing or imprinting identifying indicia by a firearm on a cartridge case or bullet, following by a discussion and description of a laser system for generating or providing, on a part of a firearm, the &quot;micro-engraving&quot; or &quot;micro-stamping&quot; tool or image necessary to emboss or stamp an identifying indicia or a cartridge case or bullet.<br />[0041]  Given foundation descriptions of the technology involved in and related to the present invention, the following will then describe the present invention and presently preferred embodiments of the invention, including presently preferred forms of identifying indicia and a method and apparatus for reading and identifying such indicia.<br />[0042]  B. General Descriptions of Firearms and Cartridges and the Imprinting of Indicia by the Mechanisms of a Firearm<br />[0043]  As discussed above and as will be described in the following, the present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for forming surface markings forming identifying indicia on an interior surface of a firearm, such as a breech, a firing pin, a cartridge extractor or a loading mechanism, to preferred types of indicia, and to a method and apparatus for reading and identifying such indicia when stamped or otherwise marked on a cartridge case, for example, by operation of the firearm. In particular, the present invention may be employed to form, read and identify a desired unique bar code, matrix, an alpha numeric code, or any desired identifying indicia on a surface of a firearm or on the surface of a cartridge case or bullet fired from the firearm and, in particular, a hologram indicia as described in the following.<br />[0044]  First considering the general structures, mechanisms and operations of cartridges, bullets and firearms that facilitate the embossing or imprinting of an identifying indicia onto a cartridge case of bullet, the definitions established in the following discussions will be used throughout the following descriptions. Accordingly, and as illustrated in FIG. 1, a Round 10 of ammunition includes a Bullet 14 mounted in the end of a Cartridge Case 16 containing a Propellant Charge 18 and having a Primer 20 in the Base 22 of the Cartridge Case 16. As is well known, a firearm firing pin strikes and ignites Primer 20, which in turn ignites Propellant Charge 18, and the combustion of Propellant Charge 18 generates hot gases at high pressures that propel the Bullet 14 out of the barrel of the firearm.<br />[0045]  Referring to FIG. 2, a Firearm 12 generally includes a Barrel 24 having a Muzzle 26 from which the Bullet 14 is expelled and, at the opposite end, a Chamber 28 for receiving and holding a Round 10 before and during the firing of the Round 10. The Round 10 is secured in Chamber 28 for firing by a Bolt 30 that moves forwards and backwards in Breach 32 to load successive Rounds 10 into the Chamber 28 and to extract and eject fired Cartridge Cases 16 from the Chamber 28 and Breach 32. Bolt 30 will typically include an Extractor 34 mechanism that engages the Cartridge Case 16 to extract and eject the Cartridge Case 16 and a Loading Mechanism 36 will typically be associated with the Breach 32 to feed successive Rounds 10 into the Breach 32 and to Bolt 30 to be loaded into Chamber 28 by Bolt 30. Bolt 30 will also include a Firing Pin 38, which is usually spring loaded and which is released at the appropriate point in the operations of Firearm 12 by Trigger Mechanism 40 to strike and ignite the Primer 20 of a Round 10 in Chamber 28. As described, the Primer 20 will in turn ignite Propellant Charge 18 to drive Bullet 14 down Barrel 24 and out Muzzle 26. Forces generated by the firing of Round 10, such as gas pressure in Barrel 24 or against the interior base of Cartridge Case 16 or recoil forces acting on Barrel 24, will cause the extraction and ejection of the spent Cartridge Case 16 and, possibly, the loading of a new Round 10 by Loading Mechanism 36.<br />[0046]  It will be apparent from the above, and it is well known to those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts, that the operations of a Firearm 12 will result in pressures and forces on a Cartridge Case 16 or Bullet 14 by various components of the Firearm 12 to emboss or otherwise imprint identifying indicia on the Cartridge Case 16 or Bullet 14. For example, Firing Pin 38 will impact Primer 20 will sufficient force that an Marking Indicia 42M on Firing Pin Face 44 will imprint a corresponding inverse Identifying Indicia 42I on the Impact Face 20I of Primer 20. In addition, the pressures generated within a Cartridge Case 16 by the burning Propellant Charge 18 will cause Circumferential Wall 16W to expand against Inner Surface 46I of Chamber 28 with sufficient pressure that the corresponding inverse image of an Marking Indicia 42M on the Inner Surface 48 will be imprinted as an Identifying Indicia 42I on Circumferential Wall 16W. In a like manner, either or both of the force exerted by Bolt Face 50 on Base Face 52 of a Cartridge Case 16 in chambering a Round 10 and the pressure exerted by Base Face 52 on Bolt Face 50 by ignition of the Propellant Charge 18 will imprint a Marking Indicia 42M on Bolt Face 50 as an Identifying Indicia 42I on Base Face 52. It will also be recognized that Extractor 34 mechanisms in particular, and possibly Loading Mechanisms 36, may operate with sufficient force or pressures to imprint Identifying Indicia 421 on the surfaces of a Cartridge Case 16 with which they come into contact. It will also be noted, and is well known, that the interior surfaces of Barrel 24 will imprint various marks on the external surface of a Bullet 14.<br />[0047]  While there are thereby a variety of surfaces in a Firearm 12 that may bear Marking Indicia 42M and imprint the corresponding inverse Identifying Indicia 42I, it will be understood that certain surfaces are preferable over others for these purposes. For example, the forces exerted by an Extractor 34 mechanism or a Loading Mechanism 36, and the areas of a Cartridge Case 16 that they operate upon, are generally insufficient for the desired Identifying Indicia 42I. In further example, and while a Firing Pin Face 44 is of sufficient dimensions and strikes with sufficient force to provide acceptable Identifying Indicia 42I, a Firing Pin 38 is readily removed and replaced, thereby breaking the correspondence between a Firearm 12 and the Identifying Indicia 42I.<br />[0048]  According to the present invention, therefore, the preferred Firearm 12 surfaces for imprinting Identifying Indicia 42I on a Cartridge Case 16 include, for example, Inner Surface 46I of Chamber 28 and Bolt Face 50 of Bolt 30, as indicated in FIG. 2, but may include other surfaces. It will also be apparent that the material or structure comprising Marking Indicia 42M must have sufficient hardness and durability to physically stamp Marking Indicia 42M into or onto large numbers of Cartridge Cases 16 and into or onto a range of Cartridge Case 16 materials, such as brass, steel, other metals and yet other materials.<br />[0049]  For these reasons, one or more Marking Indicia 42M may preferably formed directly in or on the materials of Inner Surface 46I of Chamber 28 or Bolt Face 50 as the materials of Chamber 28 and Bolt 30 normally possess the required hardness and durability. The Marking Indicia 42M may thereby be formed in, for example, an Inner Surface 46I of a Chamber 28, in a Bolt Fact 50 or in a Firing Pin Face 44, and may assume any desired form, such as a code, a bar code, a character set, a symbol, a design or any other identifying mark, and may be formed by a recessed indicia etched into the surface, a raised indicia formed by etching away the surrounding surface, or a combination thereof.<br />[0050]  In other embodiments, or in addition to Marking Indicia 42M formed directly in the materials of Bolt 30 or Chamber 28, for example, Marking Indicia 42M may be implemented through Marking Inserts 54 which are attached to or preferably embedded in the material of, for example, Inner Surface 46I of Chamber 28, Bolt Face 50 or Firing Pin Face 44. Marking Inserts 54 may be comprised of any material suitable for the purpose, such as stainless steel, hardened steel, titanium, composites, ceramics, and so on, and will bear the Marking Indicia 42M on a Marking Face 54F that comes into contact with, for example, the Cartridge Case 16 or Primer 20. Again, the indicia may assume any desired form, such as a code, a bar code, a character set, a symbol, a design or any other identifying mark, and may be formed by a recessed indicia etched into the surface, a raised indicia formed by etching away the surrounding surface, or a combination thereof.<br />[0051]  A Marking Insert 54 may be of any cross section shape suitable for mounting the Marking Insert 54 onto or into the selected Firearm 12 component or components, such as, the Inner Surface 46I of a Chamber 28, a Bolt Face 50 or a Firing Pin Face 44. A Marking Insert 54 may, for example, be cylindrical, hexagonal, pentagonal, square, triangular, round, elliptical or frusto-conical in cross section and may be mounted onto or preferably into the selected Firearm 12 surface by, for example, mechanical bonding, welding, soldering, or an interference fit, or may be threaded into the Firearm 12 component. The Marking Face 54F will generally be shaped to conform to the surface in which the Marking Insert 54 is embedded, such as a flat Bolt Face 50 or a cylindrical Inner Surface 46I of a Chamber 38 or a domed Firing Pin Face 44.<br />[0052]  It will be recognized that a plurality of Marking Indicia 42M may be implemented in a given Firearm 12 and may be formed upon or embedded in any Firearm 12 surface that is brought into contact with any element or part of a Cartridge Case 16. In presently preferred embodiments, there are a plurality of Marking Indicia 42M located on or embedded in a plurality of components or surfaces of a Firearm 12 to increase the probability that there will be at least one sufficiently clear Identification Indicia 42I on any given fired Cartridge Case 16. In addition, the locations of the Marking Indicia 42I are preferably selected so that they cannot be readily removed by a simple replacement of a part, such as a firing pin, cannot be easily removed or mutilated by other means, and, preferably, cannot be readily located. Also, in the preferred embodiments of Identification Indicia 42I, the Identifying Indicia 42I should uniquely identify each Firearm 12, and if possible each major component of a Firearm 12, such as a Barrel 24, Bolt 30 or Chamber 30, by including such information as a unique identifying number or code, the type, model, manufacturer, and date of manufacture of the firearm or component, and so on.<br />[0053]  Briefly considering the generation of Marking Indicia 42M on a surface of, for example, a Marking Insert 54, or a surface of, for example, an Inner Surface 46I of a Chamber 28, a Bolt Face 50 or a Firing Pin Face 44, it will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts that such Marking Indicia 42M are readily and preferably formed by laser micro-machining processes.<br />[0054]  C. Exemplary Laser Imaging System For Micro-Machining Marking Indicia<br />[0055]  An exemplary and typical laser micro-machining system suitable for generating Marking Indicia 42M is a selected surface is illustrated in FIG. 3. As shown therein, an Image Imprinting System 56 for ablating high-density array of vias or indentations in a surface of an object to form Marking Indicia 42M therein or thereon includes a Laser 58 for generating and outputting a Laser Beam 60. Laser Beam 60 may be, for example, an ultraviolet, a visible, an infrared, a coherent radiation beam or some other type of light radiation beam and is directed along a Laser Axis 62 toward one or more Expansion Lenses 64, which expand the diameter of the generated ultraviolet, visible, infrared or other light radiation Laser Beam 60 to a desired diameter.<br />[0056]  The expanded Laser Beam 60 continues along Laser Axis 62 and is directed through Steering Mirrors 66, which are controlled by a Computer 66C to control the direction and location of the beam with respect to Machining Surface 68 of a Workpiece 70. Laser Beam 60 then passes through Collimating Lens 72 and to Holographic Imaging Lense 74.<br />[0057]  Holographic Imaging Lens 74 includes a plurality of Holographic Imaging Segments 76 which focus the laser beam at a desired location or locations along Machining Surface 68 of Workpiece 70 for the purpose of drilling, burning or otherwise forming desired blind vias, apertures, openings, indicia, indentations or other surface contours therein of desired size and depth by etching, or otherwise removing, the material of Machining Surface 68. The size and shape of the area from which the material is removed is defined or determined by the design characteristics of a corresponding Holographic Imaging Segment 76, while the volume or depth of material removed is controlled by the power levels or number of the laser beam pulses directed at a given area.<br />[0058]  It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts that the number of Holographic Imaging Segments 76 used in a given machining operation may be variable and that, for example, a given Marking Indicia 52M etched into a surface may be comprised of the combination or compilation, in parallel or in sequence, of multiple Holographic Imaging Segments 76. The system or an equivalent system thereby allows very complex Marking Indicia 76 to be formed, and allows different elements of a Marking Indicia 42I to be formed of different Holographic Imaging Segments 76. For example, one Holographic Imaging Segment 76 may represent a firearm manufacturer, another the firearm type or model, and so on, and certain Holographic Imaging Segments 76 may be changed or varied from one Marking Indicia 42M to the next, as when assigning unique serial numbers.<br />[0059]  FIG. 4 illustrates a further embodiment of a Image Imprinting System 56 wherein a Splitter 78 is employed to split Laser Beam 60 into multiple Laser Beams 60 and Image Imprinting System 56 includes multiple sets of Steering Mirrors 66 to direct the multiple Laser Beams 60 through a Holographic Imaging Lens 74 and to a Machining Surface 68 of Workpiece 70, thereby permitting the concurrent generation of multiple Marking Indicia 42I, or the concurrent etching of multiple elements of a Marking Indicia 42I.<br />[0060]  It will be understood by those of skill in the relevant arts that an Image Imprinting System 56 may employ any of a range of types of Lasers 58, including ultraviolet, visible light and infra-red lasers. Suitable lasers may include, for example, slow flow CO2, CO2 TEA (transverse-electric-discharge), Impact CO2, and Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, and Nd:YAP and Nd:YVO and Alexandrite lasers, gas discharge lasers, solid state flash lamp pumped lasers, solid state diode pumped lasers, ion gas lasers, and RF wave-guided lasers. The specific type of laser will depend upon the specific types of materials and specific types of laser machining operations to be performed. For example, in operations with longer wavelength lasers, such as CO.sub.2 and Md:YAG infrared lasers, the interaction between the laser and the material is a thermal process which produces charring, or glassification in ceramics, and leaves a relatively poor surface quality with some materials. The processes at ultraviolet wavelengths as generated by, for example, excimer lasers, is however, and for many materials of interest, a &quot;cold process&quot; which uses energy to break chemical bonds in the material rather than to generate heat in the material. Thus, Identification Indicia 42I having excellent accuracy and quality can be easily produced in a desired surface without substantially altering the characteristics of the material or creating chars and/or clumps of material.<br />[0061]  Lastly in this regard, it must be noted that laser machining processes are particularly adaptable to the etching of Marking Indicia 42M in confined spaces, such as on an Inner Surface 46I of a Chamber 28. In such instances, the optic path or paths of an Image Imprinting System 56 may be extended by an additional Steering Mirror 66 optical path inserted into the Chamber 28 of a Barrel 24 such that the laser beam or beams are directed axially into the Chamber 28 and redirected to a Machining Surface 68 located on the Inner Surface 46I. The extended optical may be implemented using, for example, Micro-Electro-Mechanical (MEM) mirrors, which are significantly smaller than conventional galvanometer controlled mirrors.<br />[0062]  Finally, and as will be described further in the following, it will be recognized that a Image imprinting System 56 may be used to print, imprint, emboss, etch, ablate, engrave or otherwise form an image or images on a surface by etching or otherwise removing selected portions of the surface or by selective removal of a material on the surface, such as various forms of ink or deposited coatings. It will also be understood that the image or images may assume many forms, as determined by Holographic Imaging Segments 76 or similar means. Examples of such images may include a code, a bar code, a character set, a symbol, a design, an alphanumeric set or some other identifying mark or, as described in further detail in the following, an encoded hologram or a encoded concentric circular barcode. In this regard, and as will be discussed further in the following, the imprinting, etching or micro-machining of a holographic image such as an encoded hologram or a encoded concentric circular barcode variable may incorporate such encoding variables as the wavelength of light used in forming the image, and subsequently in reading the image, or the working distance of the holographic image, which is a factor in both forming and reading the image.<br />[0063]  D. Methods For Reading Of Identification Indicia <br />[0064]  As described, the identification of the Firearm 12 which microstamped an Identification Indicia 42I into or onto a Cartridge Case 16 is dependent upon the clarity with which the Identification Indicia 438 may be read. As also described, an Identification Indicia 42I may include, for example, a code, a bar code, a character set, a symbol, a design, an alphanumeric set or some other identifying mark or, as described in further detail in the following, an encoded hologram. As also discussed, an Identifying Indicia 42I may be formed by recessed or raised areas of the material the Identification Indicia 42I is stamped into or onto, or of both raised and recessed areas together forming the Identification Indicia 42I. Examples of Identification Indicia 42I embossed or printed on various surface of a Cartridge Case 16 are illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 and include a Raised Bar Code 80A, a 2D (two dimensional) Bar Code 80B, a Raised Alphanumeric Code 80C and a raised Encoded Hologram Code 80D. In this regard, is should be noted that an Encoded Hologram Code 80D may be formed from, for example, alphanumeric data identifying, for example, a firearm maker, a firearm model and a unique identifier for the Firearm 12 or at least the Bolt 30, Firing Pin 44 or Barrel 24. This data may then be transformed or encoded into a hologram, and the reverse transform or image of the hologram etched, machined or otherwise formed in, for example, Bolt Face 50. As is understood by those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts, any part or portion of a hologram essentially contains information describing or comprising the entire hologram, so that the entire hologram and the information encoded therein may be reconstructed from any part or portion of the hologram. For this reason, it is very difficult to destroy, eradicate or obscure Identification Indicia 42I in the form of a Encoded Hologram Code 80D.<br />[0065]  It will also be recognized that certain parts of a firearm, and in particular those surfaces that are machined, will typically have a characteristic surface &quot;pattern&quot; that is unique to a given manufacturer or even a given model of firearm and that such a pattern will be embossed, stamped or otherwise formed on a surface of a Cartridge Case 16. While normally considered as a form of &quot;scratch and ding&quot; or &quot;ballistic finger print&quot; identifier, such patterns, as will be discussed in the following, may be intentionally formed as Identification Indicia 42I, either alone or in combination with other Identification Indicia 42I.<br />[0066]  It will be recognized, however, that an Identification Indicia 42I is physically and visually small and may be imperfectly formed or may be obscured or deformed to at least some degree. For example, the degree of vertical relief in the Identification Indicia 42I, that is, the degree to which the surface of the material forming the Cartridge Case 16 or a Impact Face 20I of Primer 20 is raised or lowered with respect to the surrounding surface when the Identification Indicia 42I is formed, and thus the contrast and clarity of the Identification Indicia 42I, may vary widely. For example, the degree of relief and clarity of an Identification Indicia 42I may be dependent upon such factors as the hardness or &quot;stiffness&quot; of the material and the force exerted in marking the material, which may in turn depend upon such factors as the striking force of the firing pin, the pressure exerted on the wall of a Cartridge Case 16 by the Propellant Charge 18, or the pressure exerted by the Bolt Face 50.<br />[0067]  Other factors in forming and reading an Identification Indicia 42I may include, for example, dirt, tarnish, corrosion or grease on the surface in which the Identification Indicia 42I is formed, attempts to eradicate an Identification Indicia 42I, wear of the firearm, or distortion in forming the Identification Indicia 42I. Distortion in an Identification Indicia 42I, for example, may arise from many causes, such as movement, &quot;setback&quot; or rupture of primer 410, overexpansion or longitudinal movement of Cartridge Case 16 due, for example, to a worn or overlarge Chamber 28 or a mismatch between the Firearm 12 and Round 10 of ammunition, and so on. These and other factors may also operate to obscure or distort an Identification Indicia 42I after it is formed into a Cartridge Case 16, such as during a period after the Round 10 is fired and before the Cartridge Case 16 is found and taken as evidence. Such factors may include, for example, physical damage to the Cartridge Case 16 or famish or corrosion of the surface 452.<br />[0068]  The reliable and accurate &quot;reading&quot; of an Identification Indicia 42I and thus the identification of a firearm that formed an Identification Indicia 42I on a Cartridge Case 16 is thereby dependent upon an ability and capability to &quot;read&quot; and capture an Identification Indicia 42I image from a surface of a Cartridge Case 16, that is, the clarity with which the Identification Indicia 42I can be read and identified.<br />[0069]  FIGS. 7A and 7B illustrate an exemplary Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 for capturing one or more Identification Indicia 42I image from one or more surfaces of a Cartridge Case 16, such as a base surface or wall surface of the Cartridge Case 16 or the face of the primer. The Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 includes an Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 for viewing an Indicia Surface 86 bearing an Identification Indicia 42I along a Viewing Axis 88 that is generally perpendicular to the Cartridge Case Surface 86 bearing the Identification Indicia 42I. In this regard, it will be recognized that the method and apparatus of the present invention is equally usable for identifying an Identification Indicia 42I stamped or otherwise formed in other elements of a Round 10, such as the Bullet 14.<br />[0070]  Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 further includes a Specimen Mounting Device 90 for holding an item to be viewed, such as a Cartridge Case 16 or a Bullet 14, with the Indicia Surface 86 bearing the Identification Indicia 42I or a region of an Indicia Surface 86 suspected of bearing an Identification Indicia 42I, such that the Indicia Surface 86 is parallel to a plane perpendicular to the Viewing Axis 88, wherein the Viewing Axis 88 extends along the perpendicular or z-axis and the plane of the Indicia Surface 86 extends along the plane defined by the horizontal x- and y-axes. The Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 may further include a Positioning Mechanism 92 whereby the Specimen Mounting Device 90 may be positioned along the z-axis, that is, the Viewing Axis 88, for focusing purposes. Focusing may also or alternatively be accomplished in the Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84, or by a combination thereof. Positioning Mechanism 92 will typically include mechanisms for positioning the Specimen Mounting Device 90 in the x- and y-planes so that an Identification Indicia 42I or region of a Indicia Surface 86 suspected of bearing an Identification Indicia 42I may be generally centered along the Viewing Axis 88, and so that the Indicia Surface 86 may be moved or scanned in the x- and y-planes with respect to the Viewing Axis 88.<br />[0071]  A Specimen Mounting Device 90 is illustrated in FIG. 7 as supporting and holding a Cartridge Case 16 in a position so that an Indicia Surface 86, such as the wall or base of a cartridge case may be viewed by Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84. It will be recognized and understood, however, that a Specimen Mounting Device 90 may be readily designed and adapted to hold a cylindrical item, such as a Cartridge Case 16 or Bullet 14, in the vertical or horizontal positions so that the wall or base surfaces of a cartridge may be viewed by Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84. In this regard, it will be further recognized and understood that a Specimen Mounting Device 90 may be designed and constructed to allow rotation of the Cartridge Case 16, Bullet 14 or other item about any or all of the x-, y- and z-axes, thereby allowing all exterior surfaces of the item to be viewed and allowing the item to be oriented around any selected axis. The design of Specimen Mounting Devices 90 capable of lateral motion in any plane or along any axis and capable of rotation about any axis are well known to those of skill in the arts, and therefore will not be discussed in further detail herein.<br />[0072]  As indicated in FIG. 7, an Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 of the present invention also includes an Illuminator 94 directing illumination onto the Indicia Surface 86 being viewed by Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84. According to the present invention, Illuminator 94 directs illumination onto the Indicia Surface 86 being viewed along an Illumination Plane 96, or axis, that is aligned substantially normal to the Viewing Axis 88, thereby approximately parallel to the x/y plane. The Illumination Plane 96 is thereby approximately parallel to and is incident upon the Indicia Surface 86 being viewed along Viewing Axis 88, at least in a region wherein the Identification Indicia 42I being examined is located or where an Identification Indicia 42I is suspected of being present. As will be described below, the angle of Illumination Plane 96 is variable and adjustable with respect to the surface being examined, as is the intensity of Illuminator 94, so that Illuminator 94 can provide the optimum level and angle of lighting to the surface being viewed. Illuminator 94 thereby illuminates the Identification Indicia 42I, or region suspected of containing an Identification Indicia 42I in a manner to maximize the contrast and resolution of the highlighted and shadowed areas of the Identification Indicia 42I or region suspected of containing an Identification Indicia 42I, that is, the higher and lower areas of the region, to thereby provide the maximum image contrast and clarity.<br />[0073]  In a presently preferred embodiment of an Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82, Illuminator 94 and Optical Magnification Mechanism 84 include or are comprised of an optimized holographic imaging system integrated into a mono-chromatic and multi-chromatic illuminator to provide illumination from various angles onto the working areas of the Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 and Indicia Surface 86 and to provide a non-shadowing intensity variable light.<br />[0074]  An Illuminator 94 may further include facilities for providing colored or polarized light, while the Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 may include appropriate filters, and various lenses, masks and so on to shape Illumination Plane 96 as desired or necessary. Also, it will be understood that imaging systems of the present invention may utilize illumination other than visible light, such as ultraviolet or infrared radiation, and may incorporate the appropriate filters, lenses and imaging apparatus as necessary and may incorporate a wide range of illumination sources, such as a laser diode array and/or light emitting diode array. The illumination mechanism may also include various positioning and rotational mechanisms to control the angle of incidence of Illumination Plane 96 with the surface being viewed and, in at least some embodiments, the angle of rotation of the Illumination Plane 96 axis around Viewing Axis 88.<br />[0075]  As illustrated in FIG. 8, an Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 will typically further include an Image Capture Device 98, such as a CCD(Charge Coupled Device) camera, for capturing and providing digital Surface Images 100 of a selected area of a Indicia Surface 86, including any Identification Indicia 42I appearing therein. In this regard, it will be recognized and understood that Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 will be capable of providing optical images at a range of selectable magnifications, resolutions and image areas. Image Capture Device 98 captures digitally encoded images from the optical images provided by Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84, and can thereby capture digitally encoded images of a range of selectable magnifications, resolutions and image areas.<br />[0076]  Lastly in this regard, the Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 will typically include a Frame Grabber 102 or equivalent for capturing Surface Images 100, and a Motion Card 104, controlled by a user or by other elements of the apparatus, for controlling viewing Specimen Mounting Device 90. Motion Card 104 may, for example, include an automatic focusing mechanism whereby a present Surface Image 100 is analyzed to determine the sharpens and focus of the image, and the analysis results employed, through Motion Card 104, to control the focus of the optical elements of Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84. Such autofocus methods and mechanisms are, however, well known in the art and need not be discussed further herein.<br />[0077]  As shown, the Surface Images 100 may be communicated to an Image Processing System 106 through a Data Link 108 comprised, for example, of a network, computer, database or server, or other system. Then Image Processing System 106 may be comprised, for example, of an Image Processing and Analysis System 110 for performing such operations as image enhancement, image analysis and recognition, and so on, and an Image Data Storage System 112 for storing the Surface Images 100, including any Identification Indicia 42I found thereon. Image Data Storage System 112 may also store, for example, information translating and identifying various assigned Identification Indicia 42I, and may include mechanisms for identifying firearms from the imaged Identification Indicia 42I.<br />[0078]  For example, the Image Processing System 106 may include a specialized computer algorithm for generating one or more of a reconstruction, a decipherment or an optical recognition at least one of a make, a model, a serial number, a unique ballistic identifier or a ballistic identifier tag of a specific firearm used to fire the cartridge or bullet being analyzed by viewing one or more indicia on a surface of the cartridge or bullet, wherein the indicia may be comprised of an encrypted code, an encoded hologram, encoded alphanumeric code, a barcode or any other form of indicia on a surface of the cartridge or a bullet, and to analyze the captured image.<br />[0079]  In summary, therefore, the present invention provides an apparatus and method for identifying firearms that includes the steps of:<br />[0080]  (A) illuminating a base of the fired cartridge from a firearm found at a crime scene using axially homogenized light from various illumination angles using a holographic imaging system integrated into either a mono-chromatic or multi-chromatic light;<br />[0081]  (B) obtaining, through an imaging microscope, an image of the encoded hologram or encoded alphanumeric code or barcodes or indicia that form the breech face impressions on a primer of the cartridge or bullet; and,<br />[0082]  (C) utilizing specialized analysis software to read the encoded codes and provide the serial number or tracking number unique to the firearm that fired the bullet or cartridge.<br />[0083]  The method of the present invention thereby does not require a comparison of cartridges, but simply takes an image of the code embossed on the cartridge or bullet that is formed upon the firing of the firearm and the subsequent ejection of the cartridge or bullet from that specific firearm.<br />[0084]  E. Creation and Reading of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia <br />[0085]  It has been described herein above that a wide range of types and forms of Identification Indicia 42I and corresponding Marking Indicia 42M may be used for the purpose of identifying a firearm that has fired a round by embossing or imprinting an Identification Indicia 42I unique to the firearm on the cartridge case, or bullet, of the round. It is preferable that the Identification Indicia 42I be physically small, and that the indicia convey a large amount of information, such as a unique firearm identifier, a manufacturer, a model or type identifier, and so on.<br />[0086]  One of the presently most commonly proposed and useful forms of Identification Indicia 42I is the barcode, which, until the present invention, offered the capability of representing a significant amount of information in a relatively small space. The most common form of barcode is a bar, that is, a series or sequence, of optically or magnetically readable parallel stripes of different widths etched, printed or imprinted on an object wherein the widths and locations of the stripes convey the information contained therein. Two dimensional barcodes have also be developed, wherein the information is represented by an array or dots or rectangles that are read by scanning in two dimensions, or directions. Two dimensional barcodes contain significantly more information than do one dimensions barcodes, but are more difficult to form and print and are more susceptible to reading errors and information loss due to damage.<br />[0087]  Barcodes suffer from a number of limitations and problems which limit their suitability as Identification Indicia 42I, however. For example, most barcodes are normally monochromatic, which limits information representation to the physical dimensions of the bars, dots and rectangles and the uses of barcodes to applications suitable for simple laser, magnetic or optical scanning methods. The limitation to simple scanning methods also restricts the security of the information represented therein. That is, barcodes are readily readable by simple, commonly available scanning devices and the possible encoding of the information stored in a barcode is limited by the relatively small amount of data that can be stored in a barcode.<br />[0088]  Recent developments in conventional barcodes have attempted to overcome information storage and security limitations by various additional encoding factors. For example, some methods overprint a one dimensional barcode with a second barcode of a different color, use transparent ink containing infrared absorbers to introduce an additional variable, print different types of barcodes over one another, and use materials having various infrared or ultraviolet properties with colored barcodes to introduce additional variables. While such methods increase the amount of information that can be represented in a barcode by adding additional variables to the barcode representation, in a manner analogous to adding bits to a binary number representation, issues regarding security of data, reading errors and data loss through damage remain a serious problem. For example, it is significantly more difficult to read a multi-color barcode or a barcode using infrared or ultraviolet properties or multiple coding patterns than a monochrome barcode, and such barcodes are much more susceptible to damage, such as wear and fading, than are monochrome barcodes.<br />[0089]  According to the present invention, however, the above problems are addressed by Identification Indicia 42I in the form of Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs), which, according to the present invention, add additional dimensions to the information representation capacity of an Identification Indicia 42I and, in particular, will introduce a spectral dimension to Identification Indicia 42I and 42M. As will be discussed below, Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs) may be implemented as either or both of Encoded Holograms (EHs) or Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs).<br />[0090]  According to the present invention, the designs of Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs), whether embodied as Encoded Holograms (EHs) or as Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs), are based on several variables which affect the geometric construction, or pattern of markings, of the Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs). One variable is the wavelength of light or radiation used as the encoding variable, and another is the working distance of the Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs). The added spectral component is thereby obtained through spectral factors that effect the geometries of the Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs), that is, the EHs or ECCBs, themselves. In particular, and according to the present invention, sets of wavelengths are used for specific encoding applications wherein each wavelength or set of wavelengths has a particular unique effect on the final outcome of the geometric dimensions of the Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs), that is, the EHs and ECCBs, and their security levels. One consequence of this method for generating Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs) in the form of EHs and ECCBs is that numerous distinct encoded Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs) may be created as EHs or ECCBs, thus providing more extensive multi-dimensional encoding than previously possible. 97 Referring to FIGS. 10A through 10C and 11A through 11C, therein are respectively illustrated diagrammatic representations of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 according to the present invention, wherein FIGS. 10A through 10C illustrate Encoded Holograms (EHs) 114EH and FIGS. 11A through 11C illustrate various aspects of Encoded Concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 114EC.<br />[0091]  In this regard, FIG. 10A illustrates an Encoded Hologram (EH) 114EH wherein the hologram image is comprised of square pixels and FIGS. 10B and 10C illustrate Encoded Holograms (EHs) 114EH in the form of etched encoded holograms.<br />[0092]  FIG. 11A, in turn, illustrates an etched encoded concentric circular barcode array and it may be seen that the encoding of information in a concentric circular barcode results in a simpler design than does the hologram encoded design illustrated in FIGS. 10A-10C, and uses a circular based intensity encoding method wherein each concentric ring pattern corresponds to one or more specific alphanumeric digits or letters. The array of such concentric ring patterns illustrated in FIG. 11A is, for example, a series of alphanumeric codes arranged to allow an very large amount of data to be stored in the array, and to allow the data to be decoded with a reader or decoder specifically adapted to this encoding method. It should be noted that in the example illustrated in FIG. 11A each concentric ring pattern of the array of concentric ring patterns represents a corresponding alphanumeric character or digit. In other embodiments, however, and depending upon the complexity of the concentric ring patterns, including the number of rings in each pattern, a plurality of alphanumeric characters or digits or combinations thereof may be encoded in each ring pattern of the array. This encoding is further illustrated in FIGS. 11 B and 11B, which respectively illustrates the depth profile encoding method across a portion of a concentric circular barcode and a top view surface analysis of such a barcode.<br />[0093]  EHMDBs 114 may be encoded by a variety of methods, examples of which may include but not be limited to binary phase Fourier DOE, CGH, Lohmann, Lee, Fourier, Fraunhofer, Fresnel or kinoform types of hologram encoding algorithms, including multi-phase levels fro level 2 and greater phase levels. The encoding algorithms may include error checking functions to reduce reading errors, which may occur when the Identification Indicia 42I or other marks have faded or become worn or damaged and no longer imprint or emboss a clear, high quality Identification Indicia 42I. It will also be recognized that the encoded holograms and Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes may use any standard encoding algorithm as used, for example, for encoding diffractive and holographic images.<br />[0094]  As described, and according to the present invention, Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114, such as Encoded Holograms 114EH or Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 114EC, may be employed as Marking Indicia 42M to imprint, emboss or otherwise form corresponding inverted Identification Indicia 42I on such surfaces as cartridge cases or bullets. Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs) 114 may be formed, for example, directly into the material of a firearm, such as the inner surface of a chamber, the face of the bolt or firing pin, the extractor mechanism, or a surface of a barrel ramp, that is, a portion of the barrel and breach formed to guide a round from a clip and into the breach. Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs) 114 may also be formed into the face of a Marking Insert 54, which may in turn be embedded in such surfaces of a firearm.<br />[0095]  It must also be recognized, however, that the Marking Indicia 42M and Identification Indicia 42I of the present invention, that is, Encoded Holograms (Ehs) 114 and Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 114, may be used in many other applications requiring Identification Indicia 42I, and may be formed on variety of surfaces by a wide range of methods. For example, and as described, Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 such as Encoded Holograms 114EH or Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 114EC may be directly etched, imprinted, micro-machined into a surface by, for example, an Image Imprinting System 56, or similarly formed in a surface that is in turn used to print, imprint or emboss the image in yet another surface by, for example, impact or pressure, or by printing by a transferrable media such as ink or other forms of transferrable media or coatings.<br />[0096]  Methods for forming Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 may thereby include, for example, laser imaging, etching and engraving methods, dry etch and erosion processes such as chemical milling, ion milling and electro-discharge machining. Other methods may include, for example, ink-jet printing or letterpress, gravure, lithographic or screen printing techniques.<br />[0097]  In other embodiments, Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 may also be formed by removal of areas of a coating from a surface, such as an ink, paint or deposited or plated coating, by etching, ablating, micro-machining of the surface. Other methods involve coating or plating a surface layer of a first material onto the surface, such as an ink having a first property or color, and printing or otherwise placing an image or a reversed, negative image of the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 onto or over that initial surface in a second material having one or more properties that may be distinguished from those of the first material.<br />[0098]  In further embodiments, Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 may be formed of or in, for example, infrared, ultraviolet or visible inks or in materials having photosensitive or magneto-optic qualities, or analogous properties, so that the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 is readable only when effected, for example, by suitable radiation or illumination or under the effect of a magnetic field. In other embodiments, and for example, the pattern of magnetic ink may be read directly by a magnetic sensing scanner, while ultraviolet and infrared inks may be similarly read by suitable direct sensing scanners. Other methods for forming Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 may include various chemical or mechanical treatments of a surface to provide a surface that may then be suitably modified in representation of the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114.<br />[0099]  Lastly with respect to the encoding and creation of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114, the above methods for creation of a Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114, whether as Encoded Holograms 114EH or as Encoded Concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 114EC, may be combined in such a manner as to introduce a &quot;third dimension&quot; into the encoding. That is, Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 may be created as superimposed layers of distinguishable elements, that is, one on top of another, and subsequently read by selective viewing or illumination of the layers, so long as the materials or methods by which the successive Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 are distinguishable. Examples of such distinguishable layers may include, for example, successive overlaid Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 comprised of differently colored transparent inks and various illumination sensitive inks, such as infrared or ultraviolet sensitive inks, and so on. In other instances, a first Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 may be physically embossed or imprinted in the base material, and overlaid with other Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 comprised of various coatings that can be distinguished from one another and through which the embossed or imprinted Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 can be read. It will be recognized that, as a consequence, the user of multiple, superimposed Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 will result in multiple, separately distinguishable and readable Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 or in a single Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 having additional &quot;dimensions&quot; for the representation of information, thereby significantly increasing the information capacity of the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114.<br />[0100]  It will be apparent, therefore, that the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 of the present invention, such as Encoded Holograms 114EH or Encoded Concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 114EC, may be embodied or implemented for a range of applications, and that the specific form of implementation will depend upon the specific application in which the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 are used. For example, the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 such as Encoded Holograms 114EH or Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 11 4EC may be implemented as Marking Indicia 42M to be imprinted or embossed onto cartridge cases or bullets as Identification Indicia 42I for the purpose of identifying firearms that had discharged a cartridge case or bullet.<br />[0101]  In other applications, such as product identifiers, anti-counterfeit markings, security badges or codes, and so on, the methods and materials used to create the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114, and the methods for reading such Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 will depend upon the application and materials involved. It must be noted, however, that certain methods may be combined. For example, a cartridge case may be coated with a durable, non-visible ink or other coating and a product identifier etched into the coating. The discharge of the cartridge would then result in the imprinting or embossing of a firearm identification Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 into the material of the cartridge case or into the coating by removing further areas of the coating.<br />[0102]  Next considering the reading of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 such as Encoded Holograms 1 14EH or Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs) 1 14EC, an example of an Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 suitable for reading Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 has been described herein above with respect to FIGS. 7, 8 and 9 and, as such, need be discussed in further detail. It will be noted, however, that the described Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 may be further adapted for the specific characteristics of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114. For example, Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 may incorporate one or more filters suitable spectral domains of observation and the specific radiation used to illuminate the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114, such as color filters, polarizing filters or holographic filters. Illuminator 94, in turn, may be constructed as a ring light source, that is, a light source radiating from the circumference of a ring surrounding the image area, and may employ, for example, mono-chromatic light sources or diode lasers. Illuminator 94 may also be implemented to provide radiation adapted and matched to the. Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114, such as infrared, ultraviolet, colored visible frequencies, polarized radiation, and other specific wavelengths of light, or combinations thereof, or may include elements for generating, for example, magnetic fields for magneto-sensitive or activated materials. The light sources implemented in an Illuminator 94 may therefore include, for example, lamps or laser or LED sources, with or without filters of various types, which emit radiation in a frequency range and of a type suitable to make the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 visible to a viewer, scanner or camera.<br />[0103]  Referring now to FIG. 12, therein is illustrated the process for imprinting an Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 on or in a surface, such as a chambre, ramp or bolt face of a firearm, the impact face a firing pin or a bearing surface of an extractor. As shown therein, in Step 116 Product Information 118 is compiled and, in Step 120, encoded by means of, for example, a hologram or kinoform Encoding Algorithm 122 to generate a Base Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114B. In Step 124, the Base Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114B is compiled together with a Ballistic Identifier Tag 126, that is, a unique Firearm 12 identification code, and Encoded Hologram Artwork 126 to generate a Marking Indicia 42M filed comprised of the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114. The Marking Indicia 42M file is sent to a Laser Process System 130, such as an Image Imprinting System 56, and in Step 132 the Firearm 12, a component of a Firearm 12, such as a Bolt 50, or a Marking Insert 54 is loaded to the Laser Process System 130, which performs the Laser Etch Process 134 to imprint the Marking Indicia 42M on the Firearm 12, the component thereof, or the Marking Insert 54. In Step 136 the Finished Firearm 138 may be test fired to obtain an expended and ejected Cartridge Case 16 marked with the Identifying Indicia 42I and, in Step 2 140, 142 and 144 the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 captured, decoded and confirmed, whereupon in Step 146 the Firearm 12 may be released for shipment. (111 Lastly referring to FIG. 13A and 13B, therein are illustrated a hand-held, portable EHMDB Reading Device 148, which is essentially comprised of the elements, components and functions described herein above with regard to Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 and Image Processing System 106 as illustrated in FIGS. 7, 8 and 9, and a diagrammatic cross section side view of the EHMDB Reading Device 148.<br />[0104]  As shown in FIG. 13A, the Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 and Image Processing System 106 are essentially packaged into the casing of EHMDB Reading Device 148, which further includes a Control Panel 150 for controlling the functions and operations of the EHMDB Reading Device 148, a Display 152 for displaying either or both of any Identifying Indicia 42I located on either a cartridge casing wall or a cartridge casing base or the primer in the cartridge case base and the decoded and translated information encoded in the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114. As also shown, the EHMDB Reading Device 148 includes a Specimen Port 154 for receiving and holding a Cartridge Case 16 to be inspected, with illumination sources, optical imaging elements and image capture elements arranged therein to scan and capture Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114 images from the surfaces of the Cartridge Case 16. The Specimen Port 154 of the EHMDB Reading Device 148 will preferably include a Specimen Mounting Device 90 capable of receiving, for example, a Cartridge Case 16 base end first and of holding and positioning the Cartridge Case 16, either manually or automatically, so that all surfaces of interest of the Cartridge Case 16 may be scanned by one or more imaging systems and elements therein.<br />[0105]  FIG. 13B illustrates an exemplary arrangement of the interior components of a EHMDB Reading Device 148. As shown, an EHMDB Reading Device 148 typically includes a Processing System 10, Display 152 and Control Panel 150, which occupy the main section of the body or casing of the EHMDB Reading Device 148, with the optical elements occupying the spaces interior to the Specimen Port 154.<br />[0106]  As shown, a Cartridge Case 16 may be inserted into Specimen Port 154, typically base first, and is retained and manipulated by a Support Device 90 which is preferably adaptable to different sizes of Cartridge Case 16 by means of adaptable or adjustable restraining members (not shown). Base 22 and Sidewall 16W of the Cartridge Case 16 are viewed through separate optical paths wherein Base 22, which will be in a relatively fixed position when the Cartridge Case 16 is held in Support Mechanism 90, is view through Axial Optical Elements 85A. As indicated, a ring Illuminator 94A surrounding the optical path from Axial Optical Elements 85A and Base 22 may be located along the axial optical viewing path for optimum controllable illumination of Base 22 and the Axial Optical Elements 85A and Illuminator 94A may also include various forms of filters. Illuminator 94A may also be adjustable with regard to the illuminating radiation and perhaps the angle of incidence of the illumination on Base 22.<br />[0107]  A radial optical path for viewing of Sidewall 16W is illustrated as including a Prism Element 85B, which turns the radial viewing path through two right angles so that an image of Sidewall 16W is routed to an Optical Element 85C, which combines axial viewing path through Axial Optical Elements 85A and Prism Element 85B to form a single viewing path through an Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 and to an Image Capture Device 98,which has been previously discussed. A second Illuminator 94B similar to Illuminator 94A is associated with Prism Element 85B to provide the appropriate illumination on Sidewall 16W, and various forms of filters may be interposed in the optical path through Prism Element 85B.<br />[0108]  F. Summary of the Creation and Reading of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia<br />[0109]  In summary, therefore, an Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42 may be marked upon any suitable object, whether a firearm, a discharged cartridge case, a product of some form, a security badge or tag, for the purpose of representing selected information. An Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42 of the present invention is comprised of a multi-dimensional array of encoded marks, which include encoded marks determined by spectral encoding variables representing the selected information wherein each spectral variable being spectrally distinguishable from others of the spectral variables representing variables, and an encoded pattern of the encoded marks determined by an algorithmic transformation of the selected information.<br />[0110]  In typical embodiments, an Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42 may be embodied as a multi-dimensional encoded hologram or as an encoded concentric circular barcode wherein, in particular, a concentric circular barcode comprises an array of concentric ring patterns wherein each ring pattern is a circular based intensity encoding of a corresponding information item. Examples of spectral encoding variables, each of which is selected as having a unique effect in determining the encoded pattern of marks, could include a wavelength of radiation used in encoding the hologram and a working distance of the hologram, and the selected information may be encoded by any of binary phase Fourier, DOE, CGH, Lohmann, Lee, Fourier, Fraunhofer, Fresnel and kinoform type of hologram encoding algorithms. Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42 may also be comprised of a plurality of spectrally distinguishable layers superimposed on a surface of an object, and a first layer of the indicia may be formed in a surface material of the object by one of removal of selected areas of the surface material and by physical impact of a marking indicia that is an inverse image of the indicia.<br />[0111]  As illustrated in FIG. 14A, Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42 are created by (Step 1 56A) generating a multi-dimensional array of encoded marks forming an encoded pattern as determined by (Step 156B) an algorithmic transformation of the selected information wherein each encoded mark is (Step 156C) determined by spectral encoding variables representing the selected information, and wherein each spectral variable is spectrally distinguishable from the other spectral variables. The process may also include (Step 156D) the conjoining of an algorithm related artwork with the encoded pattern.<br />[0112]  The reading of Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42, as illustrated in FIG. 14B, is essentially a reverse transform of the creation process, and includes (Step 158A) viewing the encoded multi-dimensional indicia according to at least one spectral encoding variable, wherein each spectral encoding variable corresponds to a spectral encoding variable employed in creating the encoded multi-dimensional indicia, Step (158B) reading an encoded pattern representing a multi-dimensional array of encoded marks represented the selected information, and (Step 158C) decoding the encoded pattern of encoded marks with an inverse algorithmic transform of an algorithmic transformation employed in generating the encoded pattern from the selected information.<br />[0113]  G. Multiple Indicia Marking <br />[0114]  It has been described herein above that ballistic finger prints and scratch and ding markings, while traditionally the most useful and most used for identifying a given, specific firearm, are, however, pseudo-repeatable and largely random and non-specific in nature. These characteristics of ballistic finger prints and scratch and ding markings arise because the &quot;scratches and dings&quot; are largely formed by random irregularities in the surfaces of a firearm and by largely random impacts or pressure points between the surfaces of the cartridges and the firearms.<br />[0115]  For this reason, the present invention addresses the methods and mechanisms for forming and reading Indicia 42 to provide consistent, unique, and repeatable identification markings; that is, and in many respects, to replicate &quot;scratch and ding&quot; markings, but in a more reliable, repeatable and unique form. As described, the methods and mechanisms of the present invention include various forms of Indicia 52, including Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42, and various systems and methods for etching or otherwise forming Indicia 42 on a surface of a firearm and subsequently reading such Indicia 42.<br />[0116]  It must be noted, however, that under certain circumstances the Identification Indicia 42I of the present invention may not be properly formed. For example, many Identification Indicia 42I are formed by the striking or pressing of a single Marking Indicia 42M on a surface of a cartridge and distortion or deformation of the cartridge case may cause the Marking Indicia 42M to &quot;miss&quot; the cartridge surface. In other instances, the imprint may be blurred, incompletely formed or distorted by, for example, dirt, grease, scratches or abrasions on the cartridge surface, or the possessor of the firearm may have sought to locate and remove or mutilate the Marking Indicia 42M.<br />[0117]  The present invention provides various forms of the Marking Indicia 42M and Identification Indicia 42I and various methods of forming the Identification Indicia 42I that address these problems. For example, the Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia 42 of the present invention are advantageous in dealing with distorted, deformed, blurred, or incompletely formed Identification Indicia 42I, and with at least some attempts to destroy the Marking Indicia 42M.<br />[0118]  According to a present aspect of the present invention, however, such issues may be advantageously addressed by adapting or adopting certain aspects of replicate &quot;scratch and ding&quot; markings, but in a more reliable, repeatable and unique form. For example, &quot;scratch and ding&quot; markings may occur anywhere on a given surface of a firearm and in certain instances may cover or effectively cover an entire surface or a large proportion of a surface, such as machining markings left on a Bolt Face 50. This, in turn, significantly increases the probability that at least some identifiable corresponding &quot;scratch and ding&quot; markings will be formed on a surface of a cartridge case. As discussed, however, reliance on random &quot;scratch and ding&quot; markings is unsatisfactory because the resulting &quot;identification marks&quot;, or&quot;ballistic fingerprints&quot;, are pseudo-repeatable and largely random and non-specific. In contrast, the Indicia 42 of the present invention provide consistent, unique, and repeatable identification markings. An object of the following embodiment of the present invention is to increase the probability that one or more useable Identification Indicia 42I will be marked on a Cartridge Case 16 by operation of the firearm firing the Cartridge Case 16, despite such random factors such as the cartridge feeding, seating or ejecting at an unexpected angle, irregularities in the surface of the cartridge, or other random or deliberate factors, such as dirt, grease or attempts to mutilate or obscure the Marking Indicia 42M.<br />[0119]  Referring to FIGS. 15A, 15B and 15C, therein are illustrated an embodiment of the present invention to enhance the probability that a usable Identification Indicia 42I will be marked on a surface of a Cartridge Case 16, such as the Base 22. The exemplary Firearm 12 surface shown in FIGS. 15A and 15B is a Bolt Face 50, but may be virtually any other surface capable of bearing Marking Indicia 42M and of imprinting the Marking Indicia 42M on a surface as an Identification Indicia 42I.<br />[0120]  As shown in FIG. 15A, Bolt Face 50 is provided with a Marking Array 160 of Marking Elements 162 wherein, as illustrated in FIG. 15B, a Marking Element 162 may be a Marking Boss 1 62B wherein each Marking Boss 162B is a generally conical or hemispherical convex protrusion from Bolt Face 50 and bears a Marking Indicia 42M of any of the types discussed herein above on an outer, central Striking Face 164. In alternate embodiments, as illustrated in FIG. 15C, Marking Elements 162 may be comprised of Marking Dimples 162D, each of which is a concave depression of a generally conical or hemispherical shape having a centrally located Striking Face 164 bearing a Marking Indicia 42M.<br />[0121]  As will be readily seen, the contact of a Bolt Face 50 having a Marking Array 160 with the Base 22 of a Cartridge Case 16 will result in the Marking Indicia 42M of at least one and usually a plurality of either of Marking Bosses 162B or Marking Dimples 16D imprinting corresponding Identification Indicia 42I on the Base 22 surface. It will also be apparent that, due to the number and distribution of Marking Bosses 162B or Marking Dimples 162D on the Bolt Face 50, there will be a corresponding high probability that at least one Identification Indicia 42I will be imprinted on the surface of the Cartridge Case 16. It will be further apparent that a Marking Array 160 may be formed on any surface of a Firearm 12 that is capable of bearing a plurality of Marking Bosses 162B or Marking Dimples 162D, and that one or more Identification Indicia 42I will be imprinted despite a wide range of angles or placements of the striking surface with respect to the cartridge case surface and despite a wide range of conditions of either or both of the striking surface or the cartridge case surface.<br />[0122]  H. Evasion Resistant Marking Indicia <br />[0123]  As discussed previously, evasion of the above described identification indicia marking systems is a particular problem if the Marking Indicia 42M is located, for example, in or on an accessible or removable and replaceable part of a firearm. An individual or group wishing to evade the Marking Indicia 42M may either attempt to eradicate, mutilate or otherwise obscure the Marking Indicia 42M or may replace the part bearing the marking indicia marker with a part having a different Marking Indicia 42M or with a part not having a Marking Indicia 42M. In the case of firing pins, for example, the Marking Indicia 42M is typically engraved or etched into the striking end or face of the firing pin and the marking of an Identification Indicia 42I on the primer may be evaded by replacing the firing pin with a firing pin not having a Marking Indicia 42M or by filing or grinding off a portion of the end of the firing pin, thereby removing or obliterating the Marking Indicia 42M. In other instances, such as when the Marking Indicia 42M is located on the bolt face or on an inner wall of the chamber, the Marking Indicia 42M may be removed or obliterated by grinding or etching that portion of the bolt face or chamber wall. In other instances, a person or group may attempt to &quot;conceal&quot; or obliterate a Marking Indicia 42M by filling in or covering over the Marking Indicia 42M with another substance, such as a plated metal or a plastic material.<br />[0124]  It will be apparent, however, that certain methods of evading the Marking Indicia 42M/Identification Indicia 42I system may be readily foiled, at least to a significant degree. For example, the replacement of parts bearing Marking Indicia 42M by parts not having Marking Indicia 42M may be at least hampered by requiring that all of at least certain types of parts, such as firing pins, bolts and barrels/chambers, be manufactured with unique, individual Marking Indicia 42M as described herein above. Marking Indicia 42M can uniquely identify a given part in the same manner and with the same facility as an Identification Indisuch part to be identified and tracked. The replacement of one such part by another will thereby only result in a change in the specific identification code implanted in or on the part. Another advantage of implanting Marking Indicia 42I on all of certain types of parts, such as firing pins, bolts and barrels with barrel chambers, is that the replacement of a marked part with an unmarked part would require that any person or group doing so either manufacture of the necessary parts or acquire a source of such unmarked parts, which merely transfers the manufacturing problem. In this regard, it should be noted that not only is the custom manufacture of parts expensive, but that many such parts will be unique to specific firearms or firearms manufacturers, thereby again increasing the cost and difficulty of obtaining unmarked parts.<br />[0125]  Any attempt to cover over or fill in a Marking Indicia 42M is similarly likely to meet with little success. For example, there will typically be significant differences between the hardness and ductility of the part material, which is typically steel, and the &quot;filler&quot; material, and there would probably be difficulties in bonding the &quot;filler&quot; to the part material. As a result, the &quot;filler&quot; material would most probably chip or wear away in a relatively short time, possibly even with a single shot, or the Marking Indicia 42M may simply stamp the Identification Indicia 42I through the filler material, as it would through oil, grease, dirt or corrosion.<br />[0126]  It is therefore apparent that the most probable method used to evade the Marking Indicia 42M/Identification Indicia 42I system is to physically remove material from the part in an area including the Marking Indicia 42M, such as by grinding or etching, thereby obliterating or removing the Marking Indicia 42M or otherwise rendering the Marking Indicia 42M physically incapable of performing its function. According to the present invention, however, such attempts to remove or obliterate Marking Indicia 42M may be thwarted or at least seriously hampered by encoding the Marking Indicia 42M on a surface of a part, such as a firing pin, such that the removal of material from the part in the area of the Marking Indicia 42M in sufficient quantity to render the Marking Indicia 42M non-functional will also render the part itself non-functional. In this regard, it must be noted that the term used in the present invention with respect to both the part and the Marking Indicia 42M is &quot; rendered non-functional&quot;, which does not necessarily mean &quot;destroyed&quot;.<br />[0127]  To illustrate, and as will be described in further detail in the following, according to the present invention the Marking Indicia 42M may be encoded around the outer circumference of a firing pin in the area adjacent to and possibly extending onto the face of the firing pin that strikes the cartridge primer. As such, the impact of the firing pin will imprint the Marking Indicia 42M as a circular array of code bits or marks on the face of the primer. In accordance with the present invention, the encoded Marking Indicia 42M will extend along the circumference of the firing pin shaft from the edge of the striking face of the firing pin and for a distance along the body of the firing pin such that an attempt to obliterate the Marking Indicia 42M by filing off the end of the firing pin will require removal of sufficient length of the firing pin that the firing pin is too short to perform its function.<br />[0128]  An embodiment of this aspect of the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 16A and 16B for a typical &quot;hemispherical&quot; Firing Pin 38H. As represented therein, a hemispherical Firing Pin 38H is generally comprised of a generally cylindrica Pin Body 166 having a diameter in, for example, the range of 2 mm to 10 mm, with a Striking Member 168 extending axially therefrom and having a typical diameter in the range of, for example, 1 mm to 5 mm and a typical length in the range, for example, of 75 mm. Pin Body 166 is shaped and dimensioned to mechanically interact with other parts of the firearm, such as the bolt and firing mechanism, while Striking Member 168 is shaped and dimensioned to perform the actual function of striking the face of a Primer 20 of a Cartridge Case 16 in a Chamber 28. As illustrated in the present example, Firing Pin Tip 170, that is, the end portion of Striking Member 168 that actually strikes the Primer 20, has a generally hemispherical shape, hence the common name of this general type of Firing Pin 38, and at least an End Section 168E of Striking Member 168 adjacent to and extending from Firing Pin Tip 170 has a circular cross section extending for some distance from Firing Pin Tip 170. In typical Firing Pins 38 Firing Pin Type 170 may have a length in the range of, for example, 50 mm to 100 mm, and a diameter in the range of, for example, 2 mm to 10 mm.<br />[0129]  As indicated, and for purposes of the following discussions, Striking Member 168, which includes End Section 168E and Firing Pin Tip 170, has an overall Striking Member Length 168L, typically in the range of 50 mm to 75 mm, of which a Firing Length 168F, which is measured back from the tip of Firing Pin Tip 170 and which typically includes at least the length of Firing Pin Tip 170, is involved in and required for the firing of a Primer 20. That is, and stated another way, a Firing Pin 38 is typically somewhat longer than the minimum length required to fire a Primer 20 under ideal conditions, the additional length allowing for such factors as wear of the firing pin tip, tolerances in machining and assembly, tolerances in Primers 20, and so on. The tip of the firing pin thereby actually drives into the Primer 20 by a distance greater than actually required to fire the Primer 20. For purposes of the following discussions, this additional length is referred to as Firing Length 168F and is of significance in the following descriptions as being the greatest amount by which the length of Stroking Member 168 may be shortened while still allowing the Firing Pin 38 to fire a Primer 20. In typical examples, Firing Length 186F may be in the range of 0.5 mm to 2 mm.<br />[0130]  As illustrated in FIGS. 16A and 16B, End Section 168E, which may have a typical and exemplary length in the range of 3 mm to 6 mm, includes a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, which will be discussed further in the following. In one implementation of the present invention, illustrated in FIG. 16B, the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM occupies the circumference of Striking Member 168 in an Indicia Area 1681 that in one direction extends from the end of End Section 168E, that is, from the intersection of End Section 168E with the circumference of Firing Pin Tip 170, and along End Section 168E in the direction away from Firing Pin Tip 170 for a distance that, in typical and examplary Firing Pins 38, may be in the range of 1 mm to 6 mm. Indicia Area 1681 may also extend onto the hemispherical face of Firing Pin Tip 170. In an alternate embodiment, illustrated in FIG. 16C, the Indicia Area 1681 extends only from the intersection of End Section 168E with the circumference of Firing Pin Tip 170 and along End Section 168E in the direction away from Firing Pin Tip 170. The Indicia Area 1681 ends, however, at the intersection of End Section 168E with the circumference of Firing Pin Tip 170 and does not extend onto the face of Firing Pin Tip 170 except insofar as the grooves or trenches forming the Indicia 42 code &quot;cut into&quot; the circumferential edge of Firing Pin Tip 170.<br />[0131]  As illustrated in FIGS. 16A, 16B and 16C, a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM is comprised of a plurality of Encoding Bars 172G extending axially along the Indicia Area 1681 parallel with Firing Pin Axis 174, with the Encoding Bars 172B being separated and delineated by Encoding Lands 172L. As shown, each Encoding Bar 172B is formed an area that is depressed with respect to Encoding Lands 172L, such as a groove, trench or elongated depression formed in or on the surface of the Firing Pin 38, while Encoding Lands 172L are comprised of areas between the Encoding Bars 172B that are raised with respect to the Encoding Bars 172B. Encoding Lands 172L may, for example, be formed by the original surface of the Firing Pin 38, with Encoding Bars 172B being cut or etched into the Firing Pin 38 material, or may be formed by areas that have been raised with respect to the original surface, such as by deposition or plating of a layer of material that is then etched by any of several processes to form Encoding Bars 172B.<br />[0132]  As indicated in FIGS. 16B and 16C, the cross sectional shape of Encoding Bars 172B may be of any shape that can be unambiguous and reliably distinguished from Encoding Lands 172L and that can be unambiguous and reliably read by a corresponding scanning or reading device, unless too severely damaged. Examples of such cross sectional shapes are illustrated in FIG. 16B, wherein the Encoding Bars 172B are indicated as having groove or v-shape cross sections, and in FIG. 16C wherein Encoding Bars 172B are indicated as having rectangular or square cross sections. In general, the cross sectional shapes of Encoding Grooves 172G, and often of Encoding Lands 172L, will be determined or at least strongly influenced by the process or processes used to form the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM in the Firing Pin 38. In addition, and as described further below, the widths of Encoding Bars 172B and Encoding Lands 172L are selected so that the circumference of End Section 168E and Firing Pin Tip 170 can accommodate at least one copy of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM.<br />[0133]  According to the present invention, the axial length of Indicia Area 1681 along Firing Pin 38 is an Encoded Distance 176 that begins at the start of Encoding Bars 172B and Encoding Lands 172L at or on Firing Pin Tip 170 and extends along Firing Pin 38 for the length of Encoding Bars 172B and Encoding Lands 172L. According to the present invention, and as stated above, Encoded Length 176 is selected so that the removal of the tip or end of Firing Pin 38, that is, the removal part of or all of Firing Pin Tip 170 or Firing Pin Tip 170 and End Section 168E, for a distance that is sufficient to render the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM non-functional for marking Primer 20 will also render Firing Pin 38 incapable of firing Primer 20. Stated another way, Encoded Length 176, as measured from the tip of Firing Pin 38, is greater than Firing Length 168F and the removal of Encoded Length 176 from the Firing Pin 38 will thereby result in the removal of Firing Length 168F from the Firing Pin 38.<br />[0134]  Referring now to FIGS. 17A, 17B, 17C and 17D, therein are illustrated corresponding embodiments of Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM embodied in modulo 11 encoding, while FIGS. 17E and 17F are tables defining the various alphanumeric codes, start and stop delineation codes, checksum codes and so on comprising a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM. As represented therein, each Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM is comprised of and includes a Start Code 178A, eight Digit Codes 178B, an optional Checksum Code 178C and an End Code 178D. The Start Code 178A and Stop Code 178D delineate the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM by indicating the beginning and end of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, each Digit Code 178B represents an alphanumeric character or number value of the Indicia 42, and the Checksum Code 178C, if used, is a modulo 11 error detection and correction value. As also indicated, each of Codes 178A, 178B, 178C and 178D is expressed as a five bit binary code when physically encoded as Encoding Bars 172B and Encoding Lands 172L.<br />[0135]  Each of FIGS. 17A, 17B, 17C and 17D illustrates an embodiment of a<br />[0136]  Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM at a cross section of an End Section 168E and Firing Pin Tip 170 wherein the cross section is located at approximately the intersection of the End Section 168E with the circumference of the Firing Pin Tip 170. FIG. 17A illustrates an embodiment wherein the Indicia Area 1681 contains two complete Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, separated by two Quiet Zones 178E. As shown, each Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM includes, in order around the circumference of Firing Pin 38, a Start Code 178A, eight Digit Codes 178B, a Checksum Code 178C and a Stop Code 178D. Encoding Bars 172B are laser scribed and are 0.025 mm wide and 0.025 mm deep and are spaced apart around the circumference of Indicia Area 168I at an on-center Groove Pitch 172P of 3.degree. between Encoding Bars 172B and Encoding Lands 172L have a nominal Land Width 172W of 0.020 mm. In this regard, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the arts that that Groove Pitch 172P and Land Width 172W may vary according to a number of factors, including tolerances in the processes by which Encoding Bars 172B are formed into the material of Firing Pin 38.<br />[0137]  FIG. 17B illustrates a second implementation of Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM wherein the Indicia Area 1681 around the circumference of Firing Pin 38 contains a single copy of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM. In this example, Encoding Bars 172B are 0.025 mm wide and 0.025 mm deep with an on-center Groove Pitch 172P of 4.degree. and a nominal Land Width 172W of 0.035 mm.<br />[0138]  FIG. 17C illustrates a third implementation of Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM wherein the Indicia Area 1681 around the circumference of Firing Pin 38 contains a single copy of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM. In this example, Encoding Bars 172B are 0.035 mm wide and 0.035 mm deep with an on-center Groove Pitch 172P of 5.degree. and a nominal Land Width 172W of 0.040 mm.<br />[0139]  FIG. 17D illustrates still another implementation of Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM wherein the Indicia Area 1681 around the circumference of Firing Pin 38 contains a single copy of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM. In this example, Encoding Bars 172B are 0.045 mm wide and 0.045 mm deep with an on-center Groove Pitch 172P of 6.degree. and a nominal Land Width 172W of 0.044 mm.<br />[0140]  Those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts will understand that the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM of the present invention may be adapted to Firing Pins 38 other than the &quot;hemispherical&quot; Firing Pins 38H discussed above, and will how such adaptations may be performed. Such alternative Firing Pins 38 may include, for example, Firing Pins 38 having generally a cylindrical Striking Member 168, or at least a generally cylindrical End Section 168E, but wherein Firing Pin Tip 170 is non-hemispherical and is instead, for example, conical or flat or any other shape so long as End Section 168E has a generally circular axial cross section, or at least a cross section generally forming a closed continuous curve, such as an ellipse, providing a circumference into which a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM may be encoded.<br />[0141]  Referring to FIG. 17G, therein is illustrated a yet further implementation of the present invention for the instance of a non-hemispherical, or non-cylindrica, &quot;Elliptical&quot; Firing Pin 38E, such as found in certain firearms. As illustrated in FIG. 17G, an Elliptical Firing Pin 38G is generally formed of a flat piece of suitable material, such as steel, shaped and dimensioned to mechanically interact with other parts of the firearm, such as the bolt and firing mechanism. Pin Body 166, Striking Member 168 and Firing Pin Tip 170 thereby have generally square or rectangular axial cross sections and the axial profile of Firing Pin Tip 170 is a generally elliptical or rounded form when viewed from a direction generally orthogonal to either of two opposing &quot;flat&quot; sides of the Firing Pin 38E. It may be readily seen, therefore, that the perimeter of Firing Pin Tip 170, as formed by the intersection of the perimeter of Firing Pin Tip 170 with the perimeter of End Section 168E of Striking Member 168, is not a circle, ellipse or other form of continuous closed curve. The axial cross section perimeter of Firing Pin Tip 170 is instead a polygram formed by a plurality of straight Pin Side Faces 180 defining the intersections between End Section 168E and Firing Pin Tip 170. The axial cross section perimeter of Firing Pin Tip 170 and End Section 168E will typically be a rectangular or square formed by four Pin Side Faces 180, as illustrated in FIG. 17G, and in the case of a rectangular cross section, there will be two opposing Long Pin Side Faces 180L and two opposing Short Pin Side Faces 180S. In exemplary embodiments of Elliptical Firing Pins 38G, the width of the Elliptical Firing Pin 38G is typically in the range of 3 mm to 8 mm and the thickness of the firing pin is typically in the range of 1 mm to 4 mm and the length of the elliptical Firing Pin Tip 170 is typically in the range of 50 mm to 100 mm.<br />[0142]  In the instance of Elliptical Firing Pins 38E, therefore, by which is meant firing pins having a rectangular or square cross section, a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM of the present invention is encoded along one or more Pin Side Faces 180 by Encoding Bars 172G and Encoding Lands 172L which extend axially along the Indicia Area 168. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 17G, for example, Indicia Area 1681 is located along the two Long Pin Side Faces 180L, and may include two copies of a Bar Code Marking Indicia 42M, one on each Long Pin Side Face 180L, or one copy of a Bar Code Marking Indicia 42M distributed across the two Long Pin Side Faces 180L. It will be recognized and understood, however, that one of more Bar Code Marking Indicia 42M may be distributed across all four Pin Side Faces 180, and that a Bar Code Marking Indicia 42M may be a linear version of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM described above. The length of Indicia Area 1681 along the axis of the Elliptical Firing Pin 38E is typically in the range of 0.5 mm to 10 mm, measured from the tip of the firing pin.<br />[0143]  Again, Encoding Bars 172B may have groove or v-shape cross sections or rectangular or square cross sections and the cross sectional shapes of Encoding Grooves 172G, and often of Encoding Lands 172L, will be determined or at least strongly influenced by the process or processes used to form the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM in the Firing Pin 38.<br />[0144]  In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 16G the Indicia Area 1681 and thus Encoding Grooves 172G and Encoding Lands 172L are shown as extending to the Impact Face 1801 of Firing Pin Tip 170, that is, to the face of Firing Pin Tip 1801 that impacts Primer 20, so that Encoding Groves 172G and Encoding Lands 172L do not extend onto Impact Face 1801 except insofar as the grooves or trenches forming the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM &quot;cut into&quot; the edge of Impact Face 1801. In this regard, and as illustrated in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 17G, it must be noted that Impact Face 1801 is a curved surface having an elliptical profile, so that the forward ends of Encoding Grooves 172G and Encoding Lands 172L lie along the curved line formed by the edge of Impact Face 1801 and so that Encoded Length 176 will vary for across Impact Face 1801. For the purposes of the present invention, however, Encoded Length 176 is measured back from the tip of Firing Pin Tip 170 and is greater than Firing Length 168F, which is also measured from the tip of Firing Pin Tip 170.<br />[0145]  Again according to the present invention, Indicia Area 168I, that is, Encoding Grooves 172G and Encoding Lands 172L, extend along Firing Pin 38 for an Encoded Distance 176 that is selected so that the removal of the tip or end of Firing Pin 38 for a distance sufficient to render the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM non-functional for marking Primer 20 will also render Firing Pin 38 incapable of firing Primer 20. Stated another way, Encoded Length 176, as measured from the tip of Firing Pin 38, is again greater than Firing Length 168F and the removal of Encoded Length 176 from the Firing Pin 38 will thereby result in the removal of Firing Length 168F from the Firing Pin 38 and an inoperative firing Pin 38.<br />[0146]  Referring to FIGS. 16B, 16C and 16G, it is illustrated therein that a Firing Pin 38 of the present invention may include further Marking Indicia 42M, which may, for example, range from simple manufacturer's codes and symbols to Marking Indicia 42M of any of the types described herein above. A Firing Pin 38 of the present invention may also include such markings as manufacturer's or assembly Tracking Codes 182 located at any place on the Firing Pin 38.<br />[0147]  Referring again to FIGS. 16B and 16C, therein are illustrated examples of Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM, which are employed to provide an additional check and hamperment to persons or organizations attempting to circumvent or evade Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM by attempting to remove or obscure a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM. As discussed with respect to Marking Indicia 42M in general, attempts to remove or obscure a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM may include, for example, attempts to fill the Encoding Grooves 172G with metal or some other substance to &quot;clog&quot; the stamping of the indicia on a Primer 20 and attempts to mutilate or remove the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, such as by grinding or etching away the circumference of the end of Firing Pin 38 or simply marring the circumferential surface of the end of the firing pin to the point the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM is too damaged to fulfil its purpose.<br />[0148]  FIG. 16C illustrates an Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM disposed in a circular pattern on the End Face 184 of a Firing Pin Tip 170 wherein the circular pattern is centered about Firing Pin Axis 174. An Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM may be formed in the same general manner as a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM discussed above, or, for example, as an encoded multi-dimensional indicia, an encoded hologram indicia, encoded concentric circular barcode, or in any other form discussed herein, and may be encoded using any desired encoding scheme, such as that employed in the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM discussed above. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 16C, for example, the encoding of the Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM is the same as and follows the encoding of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM disposed about the circumference of End Section 168E of Striking Member 168. In this instance, however, the Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM is physically encoded as a sequence of Encoded Bits 186B recessed into the surface of End Face 184 and separated by Encoded Lands 186L, which would typically be comprised of the original surface of End Face 184, wherein Encoded Bits 186B and Encoded Lands 186L are functionally similar and analogous to Encoded Grooves 172G and Encoded Lands 172L. It will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the arts that Encoded Bits 186B may take any desired or advantageous form, such as square or round depressions or short grooves, and that Encoded Bits 186B may be raised with respect to Encoded Lands 186L, rather than depressed, and may take the form, for example, of raised bosses or mesas or of any other desired form.<br />[0149]  It will also be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art that an Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM as described with respect to the Hemispherical Firing Pin 38H of FIG. 16C may be employed with other forms of Firing Pins 38, such as the Elliptical Firing Pin 38E of FIG. 16G by suitably adapting the Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM to the specific shape of the End Face 184 of the Firing Pin 38. For example, in the instance of an Elliptical Firing Pin 38E, the Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM may be adapted to the Impact Face 1801 as a linear or rectangular bar code rather than as a circularly disposed bar code array.<br />[0150]  As described above, the present invention is directed to Marking Indicia 42 and methods of encoding Marking Indicia 42, including the locations of Marking Indicia 42, such that attempts to remove or obliterate the Marking Indicia 42M by the removal or distortion of the material of a marked part in the area of the Marking Indicia 42M to render the Marking Indicia 42M non-functional will also render the part itself non-functional. An Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM such as described just above will thereby operate in cooperation with other Marking Indicia 42, such as a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, to make the evasion of the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM more difficult.<br />[0151]  That is, an attempt to remove a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM by grinding or etching the circumference of circumference of the end of the Firing Pin 38 may well leave an Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM undisturbed, or at least only partially damaged. In the reverse, an attempt to remove an Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM by filing or etching away the end of the Firing Pin 38 may, as described herein above, leave a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM in place and in a functional condition. Attempts to remove both a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM and an Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM would require etching, filing or grinding of both the end and the circumference of the Firing Pin 38 and is likely to result in an unusable Firing Pin 38.<br />[0152]  A further embodiment of an Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM is as an Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM is illustrated in FIG. 16B. As illustrated therein, the Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM is again disposed in a circular pattern on the End Face 184 of a Firing Pin Tip 170 and wherein the circular pattern is centered about Firing Pin Axis 174. In this embodiment, as may be seen from FIG. 16B, the Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM is physically encoded as a sequence of Encoded Bits 186B recessed into the surface of End Face 184 and separated by Encoded Lands 186L, which would typically be comprised of the original surface of End Face 184, so that Encoded Bits 186B and Encoded Lands 186L are functionally similar and analogous to Encoded Grooves 172G and Encoded Lands 172L.<br />[0153]  In the present embodiment, the Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM is preferably encoded in the same general manner and using the same code as the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM discussed above, but may be encoded by other methods, such as discussed with regard to an encoded multi-dimensional indicia or encoded concentric circular barcode, so long as the Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM is encoded in Encoded Bits 186B and Encoded Lands 186L.<br />[0154]  In the present embodiment of an Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM, Encoded Bits 186B are formed of relatively narrow but deep holes extending axially into the body of the Firing Pin 38 from End Face 184 and for an Encoded Depth 188 similar to and analogous to Encoded Length 176, being a greater in depth than Firing Length 168F. For example, Encoded Bits 186B may be up to several millimeters deep and as large as the area between the outer cylinder and the 42M area will allow, and may be formed, for example, by laser etch; mechanical drilling; electro discharge machining; or any other known drilling process.<br />[0155]  In accordance with the present invention, any attempt to shorten the Firing Pin 38 by a length sufficient to remove the Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM, and perhaps a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, will again result in the Firing Pin 38 being rendered inoperative. In this regard, it must be noted that because an Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM is &quot;embedded&quot; in the body of the tip of a firing pin, the removal of a Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM by grinding or etching of the circumference of the firing pin will not remove or otherwise effect the Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM. In fact, an Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM can effectively be removed only by removing the entire tip of the firing pin for a distance that will leave the firing pin inoperative.<br />[0156]  Lastly in this regard, it will be noted and understood by those of ordinary skill in the relevant arts that an Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM may be implemented in a number of variant forms. For example, the holes forming Encoded Bits 186B may be filed with metal or other material having a different hardness, or ductility, than the material forming the main body of the firing pin, so that the difference in hardness or ductility between Encoded Bits 186B and the firing pin result in differential imprinting of the Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM in the material of a Primer 20. The material may be deposited or formed in the holes of Encoded Bits 186B by a number of methods, including, for example, vapor deposition and electro-plating.<br />[0157]  In other embodiments, Encoded Bits 186B and Encoded Lands 186L may be comprised of wires, bars or rods of material having different hardnesses and ductilities from each other and from the material comprising the body of the firing pin, the differences in hardness and ductility again causing differential imprinting into a Primer 20 and thus a readable imprinting of the indicia. These rods, bars or rods may then be assembled around a cylinder of suitable material, or in groove or slots in the outer face of the cylinder, and the assembly inserted into an axial opening in the firing pin tip, which would then be formed into a desired shape.<br />[0158]  I. Indicia Reading Apparatus And System With Geophysical Position Location and Communications<br />[0159]  It is often necessary or desirable in the investigation of a shooting scene or incident to identify not only each cartridge fired, and the firearm that fired the cartridge, but the find location of the cartridge to within the closest possible measurements, which could be to within a few inches, particularly in instances involving multiple firearms or multiple shots from a given firearm. As described, however, traditional methods require an investigation team to attach an identification to a cartridge case, for example, by placing the case in an evidence bag, and to determine the location of the case, usually by photographs or by physical measurement from a selected point, and to record the identification of the case and the location at which it was found. The cartridge case is then sent to a laboratory to identify and record any identifying &quot;ballistic finger prints&quot; or &quot;scratch and ding&quot; marks, which may then be matched up with a firearm, if available. It will be appreciated, therefore, that the present methods, which involve multiple, separate pieces of evidence and information and multiple handling and recording of the evidence by many persons over an extended period of time, often months or years, provides rich opportunities for error and loss of evidence.<br />[0160]  A hand-held, portable Indicia Reading Device 148 has been described herein above with reference to FIGS. 13A and 13B and, as described, contains the elements and functions necessary for scanning and reading any Identification Indicia 42I present on any surface of a Cartridge Case 16, including the surfaces of the Primer 20, and including virtually any form of Identifying Indicia 42I. Although described above with regard to the identification and reading of Encoded Hologram Multi-Dimensional Barcodes (EHMDBs), Encoded Holograms (EHs), and Encoded concentric Circular Barcodes (ECCBs), it will be recognized and understood that an Indicia Reading Device 148 is likewise capable of identifying and reading virtually any other form of Identifying Indicia 42I, including, for example, the Radial Bar Code Marking Indicia 42RM, Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42AM and Embedded Anti-Tamper Marking Indicia 42EM described just above.<br />[0161]  As described, the basic Reading Device 148 described herein above includes an Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 and Image Processing System 106, and a Control Panel 150 for controlling the functions and operations of the EHMDB Reading Device 148. Also included is a Display 152 for displaying either or both of any Identifying Indicia 42I located on either a cartridge casing wall or a cartridge casing base or the primer in the cartridge case base and the decoded and translated information encoded in, for example, an Encoded Multi-Dimensional Indicia (EMDI) 114.<br />[0162]  A Reading Device 148 further includes a Specimen Port 154 for receiving and holding a Cartridge Case 16 to be inspected, with illumination sources, optical imaging elements and image capture elements arranged therein to scan and capture Identification Indicia 42 images from the surfaces of the Cartridge Case 16 in the manner described with respect to Indicia Imaging Apparatus 82 and Image Processing System 106. In this regard, Specimen Port 154 includes a Specimen Mounting Device 90 capable of receiving, for example, a Cartridge Case 16 base end first and of holding and positioning the Cartridge Case 16, either manually or automatically, so that all surfaces of interest of the Cartridge Case 16 may be scanned by one or more imaging systems and elements therein. A Cartridge Case 16 may thereby be inserted into Specimen Port 154, typically base first, and is retained and manipulated by a Support Device 90 which is preferably adaptable to different sizes of Cartridge Case 16 by means of adaptable or adjustable restraining members (not shown).<br />[0163]  Base 22 and Sidewall 16W of the Cartridge Case 16 are viewed through separate optical paths wherein Base 22, which will be in a relatively fixed position when the Cartridge Case 16 is held in Support Mechanism 90, is viewed through Axial Optical Elements 85A. As indicated, a ring Illuminator 94A surrounding the optical path from Axial Optical Elements 85A and Base 22 may be located along the axial optical viewing path for optimum controllable illumination of Base 22 and the Axial Optical Elements 85A. Illuminator 94A may also include various forms of filters. Illuminator 94A may also be adjustable with regard to the illuminating radiation and perhaps the angle of incidence of the illumination on Base 22.<br />[0164]  The Sidewall 16W is viewed through a radial optical path that includes a Prism Element 85B which turns the radial viewing path through two right angles so that an image of Sidewall 16W is routed to an Optical Element 85C. As shown, Optical Element 85C combines the radial and sidewall viewing paths through Axial Optical Elements 85A and Prism Element 85B to form a single viewing path through an Optical Magnifying Mechanism 84 and to an Image Capture Device 98. A second Illuminator 94B similar to Illuminator 94A is associated with Prism Element 85B to provide the appropriate illumination on Sidewall 16W, and various forms of filters may be interposed in the optical path through Prism Element 85B.<br />[0165]  According to the present further embodiment of the invention, the capabilities and functions of a Reading Device 148 are further extended in an evidence collection and recordation device that further includes, among other functions, mechanisms for identifying, recording and communicating the find locations and identifying indicia of cartridge cases, as well as providing general communications, navigation and position determining functions.<br />[0166]  In this regard, it should be noted that at present there are a wide variety of personal electronic support devices readily available, such as cell phone, cell phones with graphic and Internet capabilities, &quot;walky-talkies&quot;, personal digital assistances, palmtop computers, geographical position location devices, and so on. In addition, recent developments in such devices are in the direction of integrating the functions of these devices into single, combined devices, usually based entirely on digital technologies.<br />[0167]  According to the present invention, such recent developments in technology are integrated with the functions of a Reading Device 148 to comprise a Firearm Evidence Support (FES) Device 200. As illustrated in FIG. 18, a FES Device 200 is functionally comprised of a Reading Device 148 module and a Communications/Position Module 202 wherein the Reading Device 148 module contains the elements and functionality necessary to scan, locate and read Identifying Indicia 42I on a Cartridge Case 16.<br />[0168]  As illustrated, the Communications/Position Module 202 includes a Communications Module 202C that is generally and functionally similar to and derived from current digital cell phone/walkie-talky devices, but adapted to the needs of security and law enforcement organizations, such as security of communications and assurance of available bandwidth and communications path availability. A Communications Module 202C may include, for example, bidirectional local and wide area Network Controllers 202CN providing communications with Internet and security/law enforcement networks, as well as local, person to person walkie-talky type communications. The Communications Module 202C will typically include an Encryption Mechanism 202CE for transmission and reception of secure, encrypted communications, and a wireless Transmitter/Receiver Unit 202TR for cell phone, radio, walkie-talky and other wireless type communications. In this regard, the Communications Module 202C and will typically have the communications capacity for high speed, high resolution graphics transmission and reception, such as required to upload Identification Indicia 42I and photographs and to download similar graphics data.<br />[0169]  As indicated, Communications Module 202C will also include Port Drivers 202CP and corresponding connectors to allow an FES Device 202 to be physically connected to other devices and systems, such as another FES Device 202, a computer system or another device, such as a personal digital assistant or a palm computer, either directly or, for example, indirectly through a wired network. This connectivity allows downloading and uploading of data to and from the FES Device 202 a memory or mass storage device in the FES Device 202, such as the Identifying Indicia 42 and locations of Cartridge Cases 16, the geophysical location of the user, and photographics taken by a camera built into or attached to the FES Device 202, possibly including the position and orientation of the photographs.<br />[0170]  The Communications/Position Module 202 will typically further include a Navigation Module 202N including, for example, a Geographical Position Sensor (GPS) 202NG of the general type well known in the art, or may include a Local Positioning Device 202NL which determines the position of the unit with respect to a locale Base Point 204, or may include both devices. As is well known, a GPS 202NG is capable of determining the position of the device at literally any point in the country, or in the world, to within a few feet, or meters. A Local Positioning Devide 202NL, however, is a local area position determining system that operates over a relatively small area but that is capable of determining the position of the unit relative to the Base Point 204 to within a very few inches.<br />[0171]  A Processor Module 202P contains a programmable Processor 202PP for controlling and coordinating the operations of the elements comprising a Firearm Evidence Support (FES) Device 200 and will typically include an associated Memory 202PM, including a mass storage device such as a &quot;flash card&quot;, for storing data and programs. Input/Output Unit 202PU will include input and display devices, such as a keyboard and display or a touchscreen input/output device, designated generally as User Interface 202PU, and may function as the Control Panel 150 of the Reading Device 148 as well as providing control and display functions for all operations of Communications Module 202C and Navigation Module 202N. The Input/Output Unit 202PU will typically include an Audio Input/Output Unit 202PA, such as a microphone with a speaker or earphone(s), and may include a Camera 202PC for obtaining and recording or transmitting pictures.<br />[0172]  As described above, a Firearm Evidence Support (FES) Device 200 will also include a Reading Device 148, which has been described in detail herein above, wherein the Reading Device 148 is interconnected with and interoperative with the Processor Module 202P, the Navigation Module 202N and the Communications Module 202C.<br />[0173]  According to the present invention, therefore, the Communications/Position Module 202 of a Firearm Evidence Support (FES) Device 200 provides all communications and navigational/position finding functions for an individual user, including voice, data and graphics communication over a variety of networks, which will usually be secure, private networks optimized for security and law enforcement needs, and thereby provides all of the essential support/communications functions for the user. As indicated, the device is also capable of taking and transmitting graphics, such as photographs, as well as of receiving graphics, including photographs.<br />[0174]  The Reading Device 148 associated with a FES Device 200 allows Cartridge Cases 16 found at an investigative scene to be scanned and any Identifying Indicia 42I found thereon to be read and stored in the FES Device 200 or to be communicated to a remote or local site for recording. In this regard, the Navigational Module 202N allows the position of a Cartridge Case 16 to be determined, associated with the Identifying Indicia 42I, if any, and recorded in the FES Device 200 or transmitted to a remote or local site to be recorded together with any associated Identifying Indicia 42I, at the time each Identifying Indicia 42I is scanned and read, and as part of the same operation. The find location of any Cartridge Case 16 can thereby be determined to within a few feet meters or inches, depending upon the capabilities of the Navigation Module 202N, and quickly and easily associated with any Identifying Indicia 42I found thereon and recorded, all without the need for other than the minimum human intervention.<br />[0175]  Further in this regard, it should be noted that while the basic FES Device 200 serves a wide range of generally desired functions, the Reading Device 148 in itself may not be required in each FES Device 200, at least not at all times. For this reason, it will be understood that the Reading Device 148 may be embodied as a &quot;plug-in&quot; device to a FES Device 200, becoming operative with the Communications/Position Module 202 when &quot;plugged into&quot; the Communications/Position Module 202. The Reading Device 148 thereby need not be &quot;built into&quot; each FES Device 200, but may be employed only when desired or necessary and only with selected FES Devices 200.<br />[0176]  In addition, it must be noted that the imaging mechanisms contained in a Reading Device 148, whether used alone or in conjuction with or as part of a FES Device 200, are capable of imaging and reading a wide variety of image type images, as well as Indicia 42. For example, not only can the Reading Device 148 imaging mechanisms detect and image such marking as &quot;ballistic finger prints&quot; or &quot;scratch and ding&quot; images, but will also be capable of detecting and imaging such visual data as latent fingerprints.<br />[0177]  Lastly, it will be understood that the FES Device 200 will include the necessary power supply system, which will typically be rechargeable batteries, and will thereby further include a recharger connector.<br />[0178]  Since certain changes may be made in the above described method and system, without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention herein involved, it is intended that all of the subject matter of the above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted merely as examples illustrating the inventive concept herein and shall not be construed as limiting the invention."
US-6993864-B1,"A locking block mechanism for a compact semiautomatic pistol includes a pair of forward guide rails, which are normally separate from the locking block. Additionally, the locking block includes transverse ribs on the sides of the locking block, which engage mating slots in the polymeric frame of the pistol and secure the block to the frame. The guide rails and transverse ribs are separated by a space or discontinuity on the side wall of the locking block. The guide rails include chamfered front and rear edge surfaces and arcuate, convex bottom surfaces. The above-mentioned features function to create a durable locking block that allows for the construction of a pistol that is more compact than prior art designs.","(1) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />(2)  FIG. 1 is an exploded, perspective view of a semi-automatic pistol containing the prior art-locking block.<br />(3)  FIG. 2 is a perspective view on an enlarged scale of the prior art-locking block and forward guide rails shown in FIG. 1.<br />(4)  FIG. 3 is a perspective exploded view of a semi-automatic pistol containing a locking block provided in accordance with the present invention.<br />(5)  FIG. 4 is a perspective view on an enlarged scale of a locking block provided in accordance with the present invention.<br />(6)  FIG. 5 is an additional enlarged perspective view of the locking block of FIG. 4.<br />(7)  FIG. 6 is an enlarged perspective view of the locking block illustrating the radii on and below one of the guide rail and illustrating the chamfered edge surfaces, as shown in FIG. 4.<br />(8)  FIG. 7 is an enlarged perspective view of the locking block of FIG. 4 showing the substantially U-shaped opening for the recoil spring and illustrating the chamfered edge surfaces of the guide rails.<br />(9)  FIG. 8 is an enlarged perspective view of the locking block of FIG. 4 illustrating the chamfered rear edge surface of a guide rail and the radius along the bottom surface of a wing.<br />(10)  FIG. 9 is an enlarged perspective view of the locking block of FIG. 4 illustrating the chamfered front edge surfaces of the guide rails.<br />(11) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br />(12)  FIGS. 1 and 2 show prior art locking blocks. FIG. 2 depicts a prior art block in which the guide rails 5 are separate from the block 7. As discussed in detail below, the present invention features a locking block with integral guide rails.<br />(13)  Referring to FIG. 3, a preferred embodiment of a pistol of the type embodying the present invention is shown. The pistol comprises a polymer frame 12, and a barrel 14 affixed medially of the forward end 4 and after-end 6 of the pistol. A slide 16 is disposed for reciprocal movement relative to the barrel and frame. The barrel has a firing axis 17.<br />(14)  The frame 12 is preferably a unitary structure fabricated by injection molding a high strength, heat and corrosion resistant polymer, such as Nylon 66.TM..<br />(15)  As will be noted in FIG. 3, the frame 12 comprises an upwardly open channel 2 extending over the length of the frame generally from one end 4 to the other end 6 thereof. A handgrip portion 8 of ergonomic configuration is also shown. The frame is adapted to house a firing mechanism (not shown) and the barrel 14. The handgrip 8 defines a downwardly and upwardly opening chamber 9 adapted to removably receive therein a magazine (not shown).<br />(16)  The slide 16, as its name suggests, is the member which performs the actions resulting from the percussion of the bullet when the trigger is pulled, causing movement of the barrel 14 and the sear of the firing mechanism (not shown). A slide of the type used in the pistol of FIG. 3 is depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,386,659, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The sear interacts with a striker type firing pin disposed in the rear end portion of the slide 16 with the result being that the firing pin would be cocked or released. When a round in the chamber is fired, the result is energy released thereby, and the slide 16 and the barrel 14 are moved rearward compressing the recoil spring (not shown).<br />(17)  During recoil, the empty shell casing is extracted from the chamber of the barrel 14 by an extractor (not shown) and expelled through the opening 19 in the slide 16. Compression of the recoil spring continues until the kinetic energy, having been imparted to the slide 16, is reduced to a level wherein the potential energy being imparted to the recoil spring as it is being compressed, becomes greater than the kinetic energy. When that occurs, the recoil spring will begin to expand and, in so doing will return the slide 16 to its forward position.<br />(18)  A pair of opposed, inwardly opening and longitudinally extending grooves 18 are disposed at the rear end of the slide 16 as best shown in FIG. 3. The grooves 18 are dimensioned, configured, oriented and spaced apart to engage rear protruding guide rails 20 on the after-end portion of the frame of the pistol. Additionally, bilateral guide rails 104 of the locking block of the present invention engage the longitudinally extending grooves 18 for longitudinally guiding the slide 16 forward and rearward. The bilateral guide rails 104 will be discussed in greater detail below.<br />(19)  The forward portion of the slide 16 is also retained and guided during its movement by the interrelationship of the barrel 14 and slide 16. In that regard, an aperture 36 is provided through a front end wall of the slide 16 and which is adapted to receive therethrough the forward, muzzle end of the barrel 14. The barrel 14 retains the slide 16 in its assembled and parallel relation to the upper edges 39 of the frame 12 and guide its reciprocal, longitudinal motion therealong which occurs whenever the pistol is fired.<br />(20)  Now referring to FIGS. 4 and 5, the preferred embodiment of the locking block 100 of the present invention includes a front end, relative to the forward end 4 of the frame, which is defined by a substantially U-shaped opening 102. The U-shaped opening acts as a housing for the recoil spring and as a positive stop reinforcement for the slide 16 during firing. The locking block 100 also features bilateral guide rails 104 on the sidewalls 108, 110 of the block.<br />(21)  An important aspect of the present invention is the combination of the bilateral guide rails 104 and the block. Certain prior art locking blocks feature forward or front guide rails that are separate from the locking block and are typically embedded in the frame of the pistol. Prior art guide rails are generally embedded in the frame forward of the block relative to the front of the gun. Given the spacing of guide rails and locking block, and the configuration of prior art frames, a separation between the guide rails and locking block is found. This separation limits the reduction in size of such pistols. By combining the guide rails 104 and the locking block 100, the present invention facilitates the creation of pistols that are more compact than prior art pistols.<br />(22)  Referring again to FIGS. 4 and 5, the locking block 100 has a transverse rib 120 on each block's sidewalls 108, 110. The transverse ribs 120 extend with a form fit into corresponding transverse grooves (not shown) formed in the frame 12.<br />(23)  The transverse ribs are another important aspect of the present invention. Compact pistols are shorter than standard pistols and the overall stroke length of the slide is shorter than in a standard pistol. Since the slide has a shorter stroke length, the slide has greater potential energy at impact compared to standard size pistols and can forcibly impact the locking block or frame with considerably more force than in a standard size pistol. Given the shortened overall stroke length, there may be the potential for overstress in the frame and locking block of compact pistols. The transverse ribs 120, and corresponding grooves in the frame 12, distribute the force of the slide over a greater area. The ribs 120, along with locating pins, also reduce the relative movement of the block and the frame upon discharge of the pistol.<br />(24)  Additionally, by decreasing the distance between the guide rail pairs, the recoil force of the slide is distributed over a shorter length and smaller area. As discussed above, in the present invention the guide rails are combined with the locking block. In light of the above, the transverse ribs 120 are important in that they help distribute the increased forces over a greater area.<br />(25)  Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, in its preferred embodiment, the block 100 has a transverse bore 106, which passes through the sidewalls of the block 108, 110. When the block is inserted into the frame 12, the transverse bore 106, is in alignment with transverse bores or openings in the sidewalls 50, 51 of the frame 12. A pin (not shown) is inserted into the bores to secure the block 100 to the frame 12. Additionally, there is a transverse bore 109 directly below the U-shaped opening 102 which accepts a pin (not shown) to secure the block to the frame of the pistol through transverse bores 55 in the frame.<br />(26)  Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, in its preferred embodiment, the transverse ribs 120 are located below the bilateral guide rails 104 on both sidewalls 108, 110 of the block. The surface of the transverse ribs 120 begin at the lower surface of the sidewalls of the block. The surface of each of the transverse ribs 120 continues upward away from the frame toward the slide of the pistol. The surface of each of the ribs terminates with a corresponding discontinuity. The discontinuity is preferably a relieved, radiused surface 130 which separates the rib 120 from the bilateral guide rail 104. Referring to FIG. 7, the radiused surface 130 forms the underside of the bilateral guide rails 104 improving the durability of the block 100 and reducing the drag between the slide and the block.<br />(27)  The radiused surfaces 130 are another important aspect of the present invention. As mentioned above, the radiused surfaces 130 increase the durability of the locking block 100. It is known that where a first surface intersects a second at a 90 degree angle or at an acute angle, an area of concentrated stress is created at the point of intersection. The radiused surfaces 130 prevent such an area from forming between the bilateral guide rails 104 and the ribs 120. Such an area would be undesirable given the force of the slide on the guide rails 104 and locking block 100 upon discharge of the pistol.<br />(28)  Referring now to FIGS. 7 9, in the preferred embodiment, both of the bilateral guide rails 104 include a front edge 140 and back edge 150, relative to the forward end 4 and after end 6 of the pistol (FIG. 3), which have chamfered surfaces 160. The edges are chamfered such that an upper and lower portion of each edge are cut away at an angle resulting in three surfaces 160 per front edge 140 and back edge 150 of each guide rail. In its preferred embodiment, each chamfer in the edge surfaces 140, 150 have an approximately 0.4 mm cut at a chamfer angle of approximately 45.degree..<br />(29)  The chamfered surfaces 160 are yet another important aspect of the present invention. As mentioned above, certain prior art pistols have guide rails that are molded into the frame of the pistol. Such guide rails are molded into the frame at high tolerances. The guide rails 104 of the present invention are received by the frame together with the locking block 100. Given that the guide rails are received by the frame as opposed to molded, it may be possible for the longitudinally extending grooves 18 of the slide to pinch the guide rails as the slide moves longitudinally upon discharge. The chamfered surfaces 160 reduce the possibility of such pinching.<br />(30)  Referring now to FIG. 8, in its preferred embodiment, the guide rails also have an arcuate, convex bottom surface 190. The convex bottom surface 190 along with the chamfered front and back edges 140, 150 prevent the slide, upon discharge of the pistol, from binding or overstressing the locking block. The bilateral guide rails 104 protrude from the frame, for engagement with the longitudinally extending grooves 18, through longitudinal openings 180 in the frame 12.<br />(31)  Referring to FIG. 8, in its preferred embodiment, the block has a crossbar 200 at the rear end of the block. The crossbar 200 halts the rearward longitudinal movement of the barrel 14 upon discharge of the pistol and unlocks the barrel from the slide as discussed below.<br />(32)  Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 8, when the pistol is discharged, the recoil forces cause the rearward longitudinal movement of the slide 16. Movement of the slide 16 causes the rearward longitudinal movement of the barrel 14 as well in that the barrel 14 and slide 16 are locked. The slide 16 causes the barrel 14 to move longitudinally rearward by the abutting engagement of a frontwardly oriented end face 260 of the barrel and the forward shoulder 250 of the opening 19 in the slide 16.<br />(33)  Referring to FIGS. 3 and 8, in its preferred embodiment the barrel also includes on its rearward underside a follower lug 210. The follower lug 210 runs onto the cam track 280 of the block and engages the transversely oriented cross bar 200 of the block. The cam surface 280 and crossbar 200 force the rearward end of the barrel to drop down such that the end face 260 of the barrel and the forward shoulder 250 of the opening 19 disengage allowing the slide 16 to continue its rearward recoil motion. When the slide 16 has reached the end of its longitudinal rearward motion it is urged forward by the spring.

The hydrogen gas is used to push the projectile from the device.,"BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />A more complete application of this invention, and many of the attendant advantages thereof, will become readily apparent as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br />FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of the test apparatus used to demonstrate the invention; and<br />FIG. 2 presents graphs representing the hydrogen gas pressures versus time for an aluminum powder/water system as measured at two pressure gages (transducers) in the barrel of the test apparatus.<br />(1) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br />(2) This invention rapidly generates hydrogen gas in purer form with higher energy efficiency than prior systems. It does this by applying pulse power techniques to a system of a trigger (conductor) wire or wires and an aluminum fuel powder/oxidizer mixture and then using the hydrogen gas to launch projectiles. The aluminum fuels used in this invention are aluminum powder, aluminum-lithium alloy powders, or aluminum-magnesium alloy powders. The most preferred oxidizer is water. The electrical energy in the pulsed form first explodes the trigger wire which initiates the chemical reaction between aluminum powder and water oxidizer. The remaining electrical energy is discharged through the reacting medium to sustain the reaction. The trigger wire can be any conducting metal wire. The aluminum fuel powder in the system undergoes a complete combustion reaction with the oxidizer (water) and high temperature, high pressure hydrogen gas is produced. When such a metallic system is subject to a high power electrical pulse, the complete combustion reaction of the aluminum fuel powder with water is ensured. Additionally, the energy content of the systems is greatly reinforced by the electrical energy. Such enhancement in energy can raise the temperature and pressure of the hydrogen gas to much high value than a chemical reaction alone can provide. Electrically activated combustion of metallic materials also displays some advantageous features such as increase in the reaction rate and controllability of the rate.<br />(3) The aluminum fuel components are finely powdered aluminum metal, finely powdered aluminum-lithium alloys, and finely powdered aluminum-magnesium alloys. The aluminum, aluminum-lithium alloy, and aluminum-magnesium alloy powders have particles which are preferably 100 micron or less, more preferably 50 microns or less, and still more preferably 20 microns or less in size. Small particle size results in a greater surface area at which the reaction between fuel and oxidizer occurs.<br />(4) As stated before, the metal fuel materials which are used include aluminum metal powder, aluminum-lithium alloy powders, and aluminum-magnesium alloy powders. The aluminum-lithium alloys contain from more than zero to 3.0, preferably from 2.0 to 3.0, more preferably from 2.0 to 2.8, and still more preferably from 2.5 to 2.8 weight percent of lithium, with the remainder of the alloy consisting essentially of aluminum. As the amount of lithium added to the aluminum is increased, the amount of electrical energy required to cause the complete reaction beween the metal fuel and water is decreased. A minimum of 2.0 percent lithium is used to substantially improve the performance of the Al-Li alloy over aluminum. At least 2.5 percent of lithium is used to produce the best results. The upper limit of lithium is preferably 2.8 weight percent above which Al-Li intermetallic compounds precipitate and the strength of the lithium-aluminum alloys decrease accordingly. If more than 3.0 weight percent of lithium is used, the alloys become too brittle for use in this invention.<br />(5) Similarly, magnesium may be added to the aluminum to form alloys which require less electrical energy to totally react with water than aluminum alone. Aluminum-magnesium alloys containing from more than zero to 5.0 and more preferably from 3.0 to 4.5 weight weight percent of magesium is used. If more than 5.0 weight percent of magnesium is used, the aluminum-magnesium alloy will be too brittle to be used in this invention.<br />(6) The most preferred oxidizer is water. Water is nontoxic, noncaustic, nonexplosive, and thermally stable. Moreover, water is stoichimetrically efficient. The oxygen is used up in the oxidation of the aluminum fuel powders and the hydrogen forms low molecular weight propellant gas. The stoichiometric amount of water which will react with the aluminum, aluminum-lithium alloy, or aluminum-magnesium alloy powders is calculated according to the following equations:<br />(7) 2 Al+6 H.sub.2 O .fwdarw.2 Al(OH).sub.3 +3 H.sub.2         (1)<br />(8) Mg+2 H.sub.2 O .fwdarw.Mg(OH).sub.2 +H.sub.2               (2)<br />(9) 2 Li+2 H.sub.2 O .fwdarw.2 LiOH+H.sub.2                    (3)<br />(10) Less than 100 percent of the equivalent amount of water will produce a working process. However, it is more preferred that at least 100 percent of the equivalent amount of water is used. Preferably from 50 to 1000, more preferably from 100 to 500, and still more preferably from 150 to 300 percent of the equivalent amount of water is used. As a practical matter, more than 100 percent of the equivalent amount of water is needed to insure that the aluminum fuel particles are in contact with oxidizer during the very fast reaction. However, a large excess of water is undesirable when it adds weight to the device without improving the performance.<br />(11) For greater energy efficiency it is critical that the aluminum fuel powder is uniformly distributed throughout the water. This can be conveniently done by adding an absorbent ceramic material such as bundles of fine ceramic fibers or ceramic sponges which prevent the separation of the aluminum fuel powder and water. The ceramic materials are light weight, electrically nonconductive, and inert. In other words, they add little weight, do not change the resistance properties, and do not interfere with the chemical reactions of the aluminum fuel powder/water mixture. The ceramic materials also have very high melting points and boiling points. Therefore the ceramic materials will not melt or vaporize during the high temperature reactions. Of the ceramic materials, alumina (mp 2015.degree. C.; bp 2980.degree. C.) is most preferred. An example of these ceramic materials are the fine alumina fiber bundles which are available in sheets or mats under the tradename SAFFIL (alumina fibre mat), manufactured by Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., Mond Division, Runcorn, Cheshire, WA74QS, United Kingdom. The fine ceramic fibers or ceramic sponges are thoroughly and uniformly mixed into a slurry of the aluminum fuel powder and water components. The fine ceramic fiber bundles or ceramic sponges absorb the water and aluminum fuel powder particles by capillary action. The fine ceramic fiber bundles (or ceramic sponges) create small spaces in which the aluminum fuel powder and water are held. This prevents the aluminum fuel powder from settling out of the water.<br />(12) Using the absorbent ceramic material (e.g., fine fiber bundles or sponges) to take up and hold the water and metal fuel powder mixture is like using Kleenex facial tissue to remove water from a bowl. The tissue absorbs and becomes saturated with the water. When the tissue is removed it takes the water with it. If not enough tissue is used, water remains in the bowl. In the present case, the ideal situation is when all of the aluminum fuel powder/water slurry is absorbed and all of the absorbent ceramic material is saturated. The process, however, will still be operative when more or less than the idea amount of absorbent ceramic material is used. The fine ceramic fibers or ceramic sponges are added in an amount of preferably from about 0.5 to about 3.0, more preferably from 0.5 to 2.0, still more preferably from 0.8 to 1.5 weight percent based on the weight of the dry aluminum fuel powder. Fine fibers are the more preferred form of the ceramic materials. The fibers will preferably have a diameter of less than 20 microns. The length of the fibers is not critical although longer fibers (e.g., 0.25 inches to several inches) are preferred. Other forms of the ceramic materials should be of comparable dimensions.<br />(13) The reactions of aluminum, lithium, and magnesium with water are initiated and sustained by an electrical discharge through the aluminum fuel (aluminum, aluminumlithium alloy, or aluminum-magnesium alloy powders)/water mixture. This is preferably done by placing the aluminum fuel powder/water mixture in a sealed reaction chamber between two electrodes and passing the current between the electrodes through the mixture. This is facilitated by connecting the electrodes with a conductor wire which passes through the aluminum fuel powder/water mixture. The conductor wire can be made of any electrically conductive material. Preferably a metal such as, gold, silver, iron, nickel, tungsten, steel, magnesium, brass, copper, aluminum or aluminum-lithium alloys may be used. Conductor wires made of an alloy containing from more than zero to 3 weight percent of lithium with the remainder of the alloy being aluminum are more preferred. The weight of the conducting wire is preferably less than 5 percent of the weight of the aluminum fuel powder. Preferably a number of fine conductor wires are used instead of a single large conductor wire. This permits a more uniform placement of conductor wire material throughout the mixture of aluminum fuel powder/water. The total weight of these fine conductor wires is preferably less than 5 percent of the weight of the aluminum fuel powder.<br />(14) The electrical discharge explodes the conductor wire(s) which in turn provides hot spots of molten material through out the premixed aluminum fuel powder/water mixture. Note that the use of a number of fine conductor wires provides a more uniform distribution of these hot spots throughout the aluminum fuel powder/water mixture. The chemical reaction between the aluminum fuel powders (aluminum powder, aluminum-lithium alloy powders, or aluminum-magnesium alloy powders) and water is first triggered at the hot spots and propagates to the surrounding materials because the reaction is highly exothermic. Therefore most of the aluminum fuel powder is activated by chemical means rather than electrical means. Nonetheless, the provision of the hot spots by the exploding conductor does not necessarily sustain the aluminum fuel powder/water reaction. The sustaining requires a prolonged discharge of the electrical energy through the medium even after the reaction is triggered. The shape of the electrical pulse applied to the medium is not a critical factor for the completion of the reaction as long as it delivers sufficient electrical energy without forming an arcing channel cross the medium.<br />(15) The electrical discharge parameters are as follows. The total energy of the electrical discharge will preferably be from 0.5 to 15.0 more preferably from 1.0 to 5.0 and still more preferably from 1.8 to 2.2, and most preferably about 2 kilojoules (kJ) per gram (g) of aluminum fuel. Too little electrical energy may result in an incomplete reaction whereas a large excess of energy requires heavier equipment without substantially improving the performance. The length of the electrical discharge is preferably from 10 to 1000, more preferably from 20 to 600, and still more preferably from 40 to 400 microseconds. Too slow a discharge (long discharge time) will result in slower operation of the device and lower pressures and propellant gas velocities. Too fast an electrical discharge (short discharge time) will result in an incomplete chemical reaction between the aluminum fuel powder and water. The apparatus is designed so that preferably from 10 to 30, more preferably from 15 to 25, still more preferably from 18 to 22, and most preferably about 20 percent of the electrical energy is used to explode the conductor wire(s). The remainder the electrical energy is discharged into the reaction mixture to sustain the chemical reaction between the aluminum fuel powder and water after the conductor wire(s) has exploded. Finally, care must be taken to avoid arcing between the electrodes. Arcing is prevented by keeping the voltage drop across the reaction medium under 2 kilvolts per centimeter of distance between the electrodes. For higher voltage drops the electrodes must be farther apart.<br />(16) The chemical interaction between the aluminum fuel (aluminum powder, aluminum-lithium alloy powders, or aluminum-magnesium alloy powders) and the water it is mixed with depends on the electrical energy discharge through the aluminum fuel powder/water mixture. After the conductor has exploded to initiate the reaction, the voltage drop between the electrodes rapidly rises. An inductive energy store provides an ideal power source for such discharge since its discharge is not limited by the voltage rise across the aluminum fuel/water mixture after the conductor has exploded. For example, a capacitor bank discharge may not discharge all of its stored charge through the metal fuel/water mixture because the voltage rise across the mixture without the conductor wire(s) could exceed the bank voltage thereby terminating the discharge. In addition to the voltage aspect, the power source should also allow a very high current to pass through the conductor wire(s) at the moment of its explosion to deliver a high electrical energy to the metal conductor wire(s) in a very short time.<br />(17) Discharge of an inductive energy store can fulfill the two conditions mentioned above. The essence of this type of discharge is to transform an electrical energy stored in a battery, electrical rotating (homopolar) generator, capacitor bank, or other primary electrical power source to an energy stored in an inductor and to utilize the inductive energy at the moment of the explosion. For experimental simplicity, a capacitor bank is often used. When a capacitor bank whose energy is 1/2 CV.sup.2 is discharged through a RCL circuit, the primary bank energy is transformed into an inductive energy described by 1/2 LI.sub.p.sup.2 at the time of the peak current. At the peak current time the capacitor bank voltage becomes zero and the current (neglecting energy losses) is given by I.sub.p =V.sub.c .sqroot.C/L. Once the electrical energy is transformed to an inductive energy, the discharge of the inductive energy is not subject to the rise of voltage between the electrodes across the aluminum fuel powder/water mixture.<br />(18) FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing representing typical equipment used to demonstrate the present invention. The electric circuit which provides the high energy electrical pulse comprises a capacitor bank 20, a induction coil 28, a metal conductor (wire) 22, and a fast switch 24, all of which are connected in series by electric cables 50, 52, 56, and 58. The metal conductor 22 is placed in the aluminum fuel powder (aluminum powder, aluminum-lithium alloy powder, or aluminum-magnesium powder)/water mixture 30 and both are enclosed in the interior 42 of a cylindrical reaction cartridge 32. The cylindrical reaction cartridge 32 is made of an electrical insulator such as polyethylene. The reaction cartridge 32 is enclosed in a stainless steel chamber 34. A barrel 44 is connected to the top of the steel chamber 34 and completes the enclosure of the reaction cartridge 32. A brass electrode 36 is threaded into the bottom and a second brass electrode 38 is threaded into the top of the reaction cartridge 32. In the center of the top brass electrode 38 is a breakable membrane 40 which separates the interior 42 of the reaction cartridge 32 from the barrel 44. After the reaction has been initiated and a preselected pressure of hydrogen gas has been reached in the reaction cartridge 32 the membrane 40 breaks and the hydrogen gas escapes from the interior 42 of the reaction cartridge 32 into the barrel 44 where it is used to drive a projectile from the barrel 44. For laboratory testing (examples 1 and 2) pressure gages (transducers) 46 and 48 were mounted in the barrel 44 in place of a projectile. FIG. 2 presents pressure readings from these gages (transducers) in example 1.<br />(19) The series electrical circuit as shown in FIG. 1 can be summarized as follows. The capacitor bank 20 is connected by electric cable 50 to the inductor 28 which is connected by an electrical cable 52 to a high current connection 54 on the brass electrode 36 at the bottom of the reaction cartridge 32. The brass electrode 36 is connected to the other brass electrode 38 at the top of the cartridge 32 by means of the metal conductor 22 which passes through the center of the metal fuel/water mixture 30. The brass electrode 38 at the top of the cartridge 32 is in electrical contact with the stainless steel chamber housing 34 which provides an electrical return path to electrical cable 56 which is connected to one terminal of fast switch 24. The other terminal of the fast switch 24 is connected by electric cable 58 to the capacitor bank 20 thus completing the series circuit.<br />(20) To more clearly illustrate this invention, the following example is presented. It should be understood, however, that this example is presented merely as a means of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of this invention in anyway.<br />(21) Example 1<br />(22) Aluminum fuel/water<br />(23) The oxidation reaction of aluminum powder (48 micron diameter) with water was triggered by allowing an electrical current pulse to pass through an aluminum wire embedded in the mixture of the aluminum powder and water. The wire was 6 cm long, 0.84 mm in diameter, and weighed 0.09 gm. The weight of the aluminum powder and water were 1.6 gm and 1.8 gm, respectively. The wire 22 and the mixture 30 were placed in a circuit arrangement as shown in FIG. 1. The capacitor bank 20 had a total capacitance of 6.times.10.sup.-4 farads and was charged up to 4 kV. Approximately 30% of the stored energy was transformed into inductive energy that was used to explode the wire. The remaining stored energy was dissipated in capacitive discharge mode.<br />(24) The cartridge 32 was made by drilling a 0.6 cm diameter bore into a polyethylene cylinder of 2.5 cm diameter and 7.5 cm long. The threaded ends of the cartridge were plugged by brass electrodes 36 and 38. The electrode 38 located near the barrel 44 has around the center a thin spot of 0.1 mm thick and 0.4 mm diameter, which functions as a breakable membrane 40 as the pressure inside the cartridge rises.<br />(25) The cartridge was installed in the steel chamber 34 with the bottom brass electrode 36 in electrical contact to the high current feed through 54 and the other electrode 38 with the breakable membrane 40 connected to inside of the chamber 34 at the point where the barrel 44 is installed. When the predetermined hydrogen pressure is obtained from the reaction the thin breakable membrane 40 in the upper brass electrode 38 breaks providing a path for the hydrogen produced by the reaction to pass from the interior 42 of the reaction cartridge 32 to the barrel 44. Pressure gauges (transducers) 46 and 48 monitored the hydrogen gas pressure along the barrel 44. The hydrogen gas pressure monitored by them is shown in FIG. 2. The hydrogen gas pushing the air column in the barrel attained a velocity of approximately 1 km/sec.<br />(26) Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the invention maybe practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein."

'these sectors are described from the horizontal pivots of the universal -,jointed stands, and work: either in slots in the sides of the gun-carriage or in other guides e e, attached thereto. They are connected at the bottom by crosspieces f 'the elevation of the gun is varied by means of a screw, g, working in a female screw in a cross-piece, h,, which is fitted to turn freely between the guides a c, the lower end of the said serew being connected with a cross-piece, i, which turns freely between the crosspieces f f. The connection of the Breeches with the sectors D D D D by means of the slotted heads C C provides for the change of the angle between the two barrels and enables the elevation or depression of Both barrels to be effected simultaneously, whatever may be the relative positions of the barrels to each other.<br />(11) The heads C C are connected permanently together, and midwaybetween them they carry the slide E. which stands longitudinally with- and centrally to the carriage, and in this slide is fitted a slider, F, connecting with two arms, j j, of equal length, which are attached to the two Barrels a short distance in front of their stands a a, and which constitute a toggle-joint.<br />(12) By moving the slider F back and forth the Barrels may be moved simunltaneously anid ad- j usted sothat their bores may form any desired angle with each other, and they will always bear the same relation to a central line, along which the sight may be taken. The barrels may be fixed in any position by a key passing through one of a series of holes, m , in the slider F, and corresponding holes in the slide E.<br />(13) The barrels are fitted with percussion-locks Ic 1c, of novel construction; but as these form a distinct invention they need no description here further than is ncessary to explain the manner of effecting a simultaneous discharge of Both Barrels in any relative positions. Tihe hammers (which are not shown) are driven by springs, and are made to strike the cap or other explosive percussion-priming by being drawn back against the force of the spring and then.<br />(14) suddenly let go. TIhe triggers or levers, by which. the hammers are drawn back, are connected each with one of two similar links, Z Z, which are connected with a small sliding piece, v, working on a small slide-bar attached below the slide E. From this sliding piece a cord or chain, n, passes over a small pulley, o, at the end of the slide E, and from thence under a pulley, p, attached to a cross-piece, q, of the carriage, and connects with a rod, r"", working through one side of the gun-carriage. This rod has a spiral spring; s, applied to it within a box, t, in the carriage (see section, Figs. 4 and 5) in such a way as to throw it inward, and outside the carriage it connects wiith a le- ver, ac. The barrels are discharged sinmulta- neously biy pulling thi s lever oiitward and su d- denly letting it go. This is effected bythele- ver dLrawinlg out the rod r"" and drawving the cord n, to draw forward the links Z Z, and thus drawing back the hammers against the springs before spoken of as being applied to them to produce percussion. The effect of these springs is assisted by the spring s, which quickly slackens the cord or chain when the lever ac is let go. It is evident that, as the relative positions of the barrels vary, the effective length of the cord or chain ac ]ust also vary, as, in order to be operative, the cord or chain must be kept tight. or nearly so. In ordcr to vary the length of the cord or chain, it is not connected fixedlly with the rodl r, but merely passes through an eye innis end, and thence to a winch, wv, on wihich it is wound or unwound, as may be required, by means of a handle, x, outside the carriage.<br />(15) Having thus fully described mxy inventign,"
US-0299302-A,,"(1) 2O abb whwn77 It 7flztU Comeern'7:<br />(2) Be it known that I, THORSTEN NOEtDEN- FELT, civil engineer, a subject of the King of Sweden, residing at 53 Parliament street, in the city of Westminster, England, have invented a Carriage for Machine Guns Specially Adapted for the Defense of Parapets, of which the following is a specification.<br />(3) This i nvention has for its obj ect a carriage for is an automatic or machine gun. This carriage is specially designed for the Maxim automatic gun, but is applicable, also, to other machine- guns of small caliber. The carriage is intended to adapt such guns for more convenient use upon ramparts and in shelter-trenches. A pair of wheels mon nted on an axle carries a frame or socket-piece so mounted as to be able to turn on the axle. The socket-piece supports the gun and gun-mounting, with the usual appliances for elevatinog aud dersigand for training the gun upon the object. In the socket a pole crossing the axle at right angles is carried. When traveling, the gun is drawn by men holding handles at the fore end of the pole. The pole also serves as a support for the gun when in action. When the gun is mounted for action, the pole occupies an inclined position. Its lower end rests upon the ground and the handles at its upper end bear upon the top of the parapet. The handles are provided with claws to enable them to take a firm hold. The gtun is raised to the elevation required by sliding the socket-piece along the pole. To facilitate this, the axle has a pinion fast upon it, and the pinion gears with rack- teeth formed upon the pole. There is also a clutch sliding upon the axle. By means of the clutch the axle can be made fast to one of the wheels. When the clutch is engaged, by turning the wheel by manual labor the gun-car- riage is caused to mount up along the inclined pole until the muzzle of the gun is above the parapet. The socket-piece is locked fast upon the pole by means of a clamp provided for the purpose.<br />(4) In order that my said invention may be fully understood and readily carried into ef- fect, I will proceed to describe the drawings hereunto annexed.<br />(5) In the drawings, Figure 1 is a side elevation ot the gun andi carriage as they appear mnountedi for use behind a parapet. Fig. 2 is a plan, partly in section, of the same.<br />(6) A A is a M~aximn rifle-caliber gun of the ordinary construction, and B is a standard to which it is jointed at A'. This standard B is carried upon tihe socket-piece C in such manner that it can rotate horizontally to allow of the gun being trained upon the mark.

The surface whose emissivity is to be controlled, is covered with one or more elements according to the invention, which are electrically connected with one another and can be wired in the form of strings or arrays.","[0025] Other objects, advantages and novel features of the present invention will become apparent from the following detailed description of the invention when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br />BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <br />[0026] FIGS. 1 and 2 show representative embodiments of the element according to the invention.<br />DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <br />[0027] FIG. 1 illustrates a first embodiment of the element according to the invention. It comprises the following layer structure:<br />[0028] An electrode layer 2 consisting of an electrically conductive material, such as Au, Al, Pt, Pd, Cu, or a conductive oxide, such as ITO;<br />[0029] a proton storage layer 3, such as WO.sub.3, Y, NiO, LaNi.sub.5, FeTi, Pd etc.;<br />[0030] an anhydrous IR-absorptive proton conductor 4, preferably containing mobile proton carriers, such as imidazole or pyrazole. The proton conductor layer can consist, for example, of sulfonated polyetherketone (PEK) or polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or polyaryletherketone (PAEK).<br />[0031] a function layer 5 consisting of yttrium Y or yttrium dihydride YH.sub.2 or the hydride of another rare-earth metal (such as scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium). Advantageously, a thin layer (such as Pd, Pt, NbO.sub.3, V.sub.2O.sub.5, etc.) for a protection against oxidation is applied to the function layer (not shown in FIG. 1).<br />[0032] a substrate 6 as a carrier made of a material, such as silicon, germanium, etc. which is transparent to infrared radiation;<br />[0033] an antireflection layer 7 or an antireflection layer system consisting of several individual layers which have an antireflection effect in the IR wavelength range.<br />[0034] The embodiment of the element according to the invention illustrated in FIG. 2 differs from that of FIG. 1 by the addition of a second substrate 1 made of a material, which is arbitrary--with respect to the IR transparency,--as the carrier for the rearward part of the cell. During the manufacture of the element, the function layer 5 is applied to the forward substrate 6 and the electrode layer 2 is applied to the rearward substrate 1, and the hydrogen storage layer 3 can be applied to the electrode layer 2. The two thus coated substrates can then be connected by means of the proton conductor 4 which is simultaneously used as a gluing material. Particularly sulfonated polyetherketone (PEK) or polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or polyaryletherketone (PAEK) with mobile proton carriers, such as imidazole or pyrazole, are suitable as materials for the proton conductor.<br />[0035] The method of operation of the embodiments of the invention is the same in both cases. If an electric voltage of typically 2 V is applied to the two electrodes 2 and 5, with the minus pole of the voltage source contacting the function layer 5, (made, for example, of YH.sub.2), positively charged protons move through the proton conductor 4 from the storage layer 3 into the function layer 5 and are neutralized there. When a sufficiently large number of hydrogen atoms are embedded, this function layer changes into YH.sub.3 which has semiconducting properties and is transparent to infrared radiation. In this case, incident radiation can penetrate to the proton conductor 4 which has an absorption of virtually 100%. The surface of the element is therefore highly emitting.<br />[0036] If the poles of the electric voltage are reversed, so that the plus pole contacting the function layer 5, protons move through the proton conductor 4 back into the storage layer and the function layer 5 is converted back to the stable YH.sub.2, which has a metallic character and represents a wide-band mirror for infrared radiation. In this condition, the surface of the element has a low emission.<br />[0037] The foregoing disclosure has been set forth merely to illustrate the invention and is not intended to be limiting. Since modifications of the disclosed embodiments incorporating the spirit and substance of the invention may occur to persons skilled in the art, the invention should be construed to include everything within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereof."
US-3936148-A,"A head-up display unit for use for example in an aircraft has (a) a porthole part of a source of collimated luminous signals disposed directly in the field of view of an observer when looking at a scene ahead of him from an observation position thus obscuring part of his view and (b) a combining optical system disposed adjacent the porthole part and having plane optical surfaces which transmit to the observer's eyes light from the porthole directly, and light from the scene ahead by reflection, whereby the observer sees in superposed relationship the scene ahead and a display of collimated luminous signals. In a preferred arrangement the plane optical faces are constituted by plane boundary faces of prisms cemented together to form a stable assembly.","(1) Referring now to the FIGS. 1 to 3, a pilot 10 seated normally in an aircraft cockpit views the scene ahead of the aircraft over the aircraft nose through a head-up display unit 11 which is mounted between the pilot's head and the forward wind-shield 12 of the cockpit. The display unit has a lower mounting part 13 by means of which the unit is carried centrally in a space provided in the upper part of the pilot's forward instrument panel 14.<br />(2) The display unit has a longitudinal optical axis 15 which extends to the pilot's eye when the pilot's head is in the &quot;operational eye&quot; position shown.<br />(3) Within an outer casing 16, the display unit includes a linear arrangement of components, aligned along the longitudinal optical axis 15. At the forward end (i.e. relative to the aircraft) is disposed a cathode ray tube 17 having adjacent its rearwardly-facing screen 18 a collimating optical system 19. The casing has at its rearward end a porthole 20 through which collimated luminous signals may be observed. Disposed across and covering the porthole 20 is a horizontally-arranged transverse composite prism assembly 21, the rear face of which is presented directly to the pilot's view.<br />(4) The prism assembly 21 has rear and forward faces 22, 23 which are plane and parallel with one another, and upper and lower faces 24, 25 which are plane and parallel to one another, and normal to the rear end forward faces 22, 23. The assembly comprises a plurality of glass prisms which are cemented together in such a manner that the inter-faces between adjacent prisms constitute plane optical faces which are capable of simultaneously transmitting and reflecting light rays in a manner that will be apparent from what follows. The various prisms all have the same glass composition and hence the same optical properties.<br />(5) As best shown in FIG. 2 the prism assembly includes a central prism 26 of triangular transverse cross section, which prism has a free plane face 27 which spans the porthole 20 and second and third plane faces 28, 29 which meet at the rear vertical edge 30 and which are cemented to adjacent plane faces 31, 32 of two similar but complementary intermediate prisms 33, 34.<br />(6) The intermediate prism 33 has a further plane face 35 which is parallel to the plane face 31 and which is cemented to a corresponding plane face 36 of an outer prism 37 of triangular transverse crosssection.<br />(7) Likewise, the intermediate prism 34 has a further plane face 38 which is parallel to the plane face 32 and which is cemented to a corresponding plane face 39 of an outer prism 40 of triangular transverse cross section.<br />(8) The intermediate prisms 33, 34 are cemented to one another along narrow, vertical plane faces which meet one another adjacent the rear edge 30 of the central prism 26.<br />(9) The cathode ray tube 17 is connected with a high voltage power supply unit 41, and with an amplifier unit 42 which supplies X and Y deflection signals to the respective deflection systems of the tube. The amplifier unit is in turn fed with appropriate electrical signals by a computing apparatus 43 which has input circuits for receiving input signals from which it is to compute data to be displayed by the cathode ray tube 17 at the porthole 20. The high and low voltage power supply units 41 and 44 have an input circuit for receiving electric power from a supply source.<br />(10) In operation, luminous signals produced at the porthole 20 of the collimating optical system 19 will, when of appropriately high intensity, be observed by the pilot through the partially lighttransmitting, inclined, plane interfaces 28, 31 and 29, 32 of the prisms 26, 33, 34. These signals will appear as if at an infinite distance. However, the pilot will not see the darker parts of the cathode ray tube screen through the porthole. Instead the pilot will see on the partially light-reflecting, inclined, plane interfaces 28, 31 and 29, 32 of the prisms 26, 33, 34 an image of the scene ahead of the aircraft, as would be seen by the pilot if the pilot's forward view were not obstructed by the cathode ray tube 17 and collimating optical system 19. How this is achieved will be explained later.<br />(11) The prism assembly is designed so that the pilot cannot see the side surfaces of the display unit casing 16, or of the aircraft nose, so long as he does not move his head outside a predetermined 3-dimensional zone of permitted head motion. This zone can be made large enough to encompass all normal head positions of the pilot when performing the task of piloting the aircraft.<br />(12) It will be noted that the longitudinal optical axis 15 is inclined downwardly from a horizontal datum, as represented by the chain-dotted line 45, so as to be aligned with the normal direction of vision required by the pilot when he is performing a task (such as landing or following an aerial target) demanding his concentration and an unobstructed view just over the aircraft nose.<br />(13) When the pilot is performing some less demanding task, such as when flying in level flight condition under auto-pilot control, the pilot's hand will normally occupy a more relaxed position to the rear of and slightly higher than that indicated. In this case the pilot's eye will occupy a so-called &quot;design eye position&quot; indicated at 46 instead of the so-called operational eye position shown in the FIG. 1. In the design eye position the pilot may observe the scene ahead alternatively through the HUD display unit 11, or when a more distant view is required by looking over that unit.<br />(14) A shaded quadrilateral defined by the points 47 to 50 in FIG. 1 indicates the zone of eye positions in which effective uninterrupted vision through the display unit can be achieved, the upper boundary of the quadrilateral setting the limit for eye positions disposed higher than the design and operational eye positions, and the lower boundary of the quadrilateral setting the limit for eye positions disposed lower than the design and operational positions.<br />(15) The modified display unit shown in FIG. 4 is generally similar to that shown in and described with reference to the FIGS. 1 to 3, through the assembly of prisms does not include the outer triangular prism 37 and 40, and the outer plane faces 35 and 38 are made totally reflecting instead. Thus whereas in the unit of FIGS. 1 to 3, the pilot could see the scene ahead through a rearward viewing face extending from corner 51 to corner 52 of the prism assembly, in the unit of FIG. 4 the rearward face extends only from the corner 53 to the corner 54. However, the unit of FIG. 4 is generally preferred since all the light rays from the scene ahead are reflected twice and hence suffer equal losses, whereas in the unit of FIGS. 1 to 3 light rays transmitted directly through the outer triangular prisms 37 and 40 without deflection suffer losses which are different from those suffered by the same light rays when reflected twice before reaching the observer's eyes. Hence, unless very great care is exercised in the design of the prism assembly, the scene ahead as viewed through the optical system of FIGS. 1 to 3 may undesirably exhibit successive vertical bands of different average light intensities.<br />(16) In FIG. 4 the constraints placed upon the pilot's forward field of view by the windshield frame 55 are indicated. The normal `operational eye` positions are shown at 56, 57, separated by a typical inter-pupillary distance Y.<br />(17) In the display units shown in the FIGS. 1 to 3 and in FIG. 4, the rear edge 30 of the central prism 26 lies forward of the rear face 22 of the assembly. However, in some circumstances the design of the prism assembly is such that the rear edge 30 lies in the plane of the rear face 22 of the assembly. Such an arrangement is shown in the modified form of display unit shown in FIG. 7. This arrangement is achieved by reducing the angle between the partly transmissive-partly reflective faces 28, 29 of the triangular prism 26 to a value below 90.degree.. This modified form of display unit also has the feature that the forward plane faces 58, 59 of the outer prisms 33, 34 lie forward of the forward free plane face 27 of the central prism 26, so that a forward part 60, 61 of each of the outer prisms lies alongside the rear part of the housing 16.<br />(18) The display units so far described may be modified so as to accommodate an additional luminous source for providing in the porthole 20 a second set of luminous data signals, preferably displayed in a distinctive colour. This may be achieved by incorporating in the collimating optical system a prism assembly comprising two triangular prisms cemented together to define at the interface of the two prisms a partially-reflective/partially-transmissive plane optical face which is inclined to the longitudinal optical axis 15. This inclined face is arranged to transmit the signals of the first cathode ray tube 17 without deflection to the porthole 20, and at the same time to reflect to the porthole 20 luminous signals produced on the screen of a second cathode ray tube which is disposed below the inclined face and which is appropriately inclined to the longitudinal optical axis 15.<br />(19) By providing at the inclined interface of these two prisms a dichroic layer or film, the luminous signal display seen at the porthole can comprise for example a display of green signals provided by the first cathode ray tube 17 and a superposed display of red signals provided by the second cathode ray tube. In this case the dichroic layer transmits signals in the green part of the colour spectrum and reflects signals in the red part of that spectrum.<br />(20) Such a modified two colour display unit is shown in the FIG. 8, where the second cathode ray tube is shown at 62, the two prisms at 63, 64 and the dichroic layer at 65. This Figure also shows how a camera unit 66 may be attached to the display unit so as to photograph the whole or some preferred part of the composite view presented to the pilot at the rear face 22 of the prism assembly 21.<br />(21) This modified unit has a sectional plan view along the longitudinal optical axis which is generally similar to that shown in the FIG. 2.<br />(22) The design of the prismatic assemblies referred to above is based on various considerations which will now be explained with reference to FIGS. 4 to 6 and 9 to 11. In the FIGS. 4 to 6 the pilot's eyes are represented by the dots E.sub.R and E.sub.L, the subscripts R and L denoting respectively the right and left hand sides of the pilot. Furthermore, the inner reflective-transmissive faces at 28, 31 and 29, 32 are referred to as I.sub.R and I.sub.L respectively, and the outer reflective faces at 35 and 38 are referred to as O.sub.R and O.sub.L respectively.<br />(23) As in the case of FIG. 1 allowance for a reasonable range of normal transverse head movement on the part of the pilot must be allowed for, so that the pilot can have a desired forward view no matter where his head may be within a predetermined range of positions.<br />(24) The pilot may for example wish to move his head to one side or the other so as to see some part of the display of luminous signals which is not within his field of vision when his head is in the central position. Thus the prism system must be such as to prevent the pilot's view being interrupted by the casing 16 even when his head is displaced sideways within the said range. The said range is indicated by the limiting positions of the right and left eyes indicated at E.sub.RL and E.sub.LL. Hence, in FIG. 4 the aforesaid zone of permitted head motion is represented by the shaded rectangle which is bounded at front and rear by the planes containing the operational and design eye positions.<br />(25) In looking ahead at the distant scene from the normal (central) eye positions E.sub.R and E.sub.L the pilot's eyes will see at the inner reflecting faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L, by virtue of reflection from the outer faces O.sub.R, O.sub.L, scenes in the respective hidden fields F.sub.R and F.sub.L which lie directly behind and are obscured by the inner faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L. The boundaries defining the actual fields of view F'.sub.R and F'.sub.L are almost parallel with those of the fields F.sub.R and F.sub.L by virtue of the relatively small lateral shift of the light rays resulting from the double reflection at the parallel reflecting surfaces (a shift of a new centimetres in relation to light travelling from objects some kiometres away).<br />(26) Further, the eyes may also perceive at the same time light passing through the prism assembly 21 without reflection. Objects seen by virtue of such light appear in proper spatial relation with respect to objects which are seen within the fields F.sub.R, F.sub.L by virtue of the double reflection at the parallel reflecting surfaces. Transverse movement of the head to one side of the longitudinal optical axis 15 enables a shifting field of view to be seen, progressively more of which is seen by one eye by direct vision through the prism assembly and progressively less by virtue of double reflection, and vice versa for the other eye.<br />(27) As each eye transfers its gaze across the common rear edge 30 of the two inner reflecting faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L that eye cannot perceive the casing 16 on either of those faces, and the eyes are unaware of that edge as they scan the rear surface of the prism assembly, looking at the distant scene.<br />(28) Though at any instant each eye may perceive (a) light rays transmitted directly through the prism 33 or 34 ahead, (b) light rays transmitted by reflection at one pair of parallel faces, (e.g. I.sub.R, O.sub.R) and (c) light rays transmitted by reflection at the other pair of parallel faces (e.g. I.sub.L, O.sub.L) the pilot is aware only of an accurate reconstruction of the scene ahead of him, even though parts of that scene are hidden from his direct view.<br />(29) As the pilot moves his head to one side or the other of the longitudinally optical axis 15, or scans his eyes horizontally, the scene appearing within his view changes in true manner as though the display unit were not obstructing his view.<br />(30) In the FIG. 5 various fields of view of the left hand eye E.sub.L when in the extreme position E.sub.LL are indicated at D.sub.L, R.sub.L, R.sub.R, D.sub.R. Thus in scanning that eye horizontally from left to right, the direct view D.sub.L is scanned first, followed in succession by the reflected view R.sub.L, the reflected view R.sub.R, and the direct view D.sub.R.<br />(31) It will be appreciated that when scanning the eyes from right to left, until the left eye E.sub.L reaches the extreme right hand limit 69 of its vision, the right eye is `blind` (so far as vision through the prism assembly 21 is concerned) until it is aligned to perceive the light ray 70, so that within this range of scanning the pilot's vision results solely from the light perceived by the left eye E.sub.L.<br />(32) As the scanning process continues, both eyes perceive light via the prism assembly 21, and so contribute jointly to the pilot's vision. This continues until the left eye loses sight of the limiting rays 71, whereafter this eye becomes `blind` (so far as vision through the prism assembly 21 is concerned) for the rest of the scan. The scan ceases when the right eye E.sub.R loses sight of the limiting ray 72, whereafter the pilot receives no vision of the scene ahead through the prism assembly 21.<br />(33) FIG. 9 depicts against a representation of a mountainous scene ahead of an aircraft the outline of the prism assembly 21 of the headup display unit. Though the pilot when looking at the outline of the prism assembly as such will see the outline thereof as depicted, when scanning the horizon through the prism assembly with his eyes focussed `at infinity`, he will perceive the mountainous scene ahead as portrayed, substantially as if the outline of the prism assembly did not exist. Furthermore, if a distant aeroplane flying over the mountains were to traverse the flight path of his aircraft, the pilot could follow, without interruption of his view, the flight of the aeroplane as it passes across his horizon.<br />(34) Thus the design of the prism assemblies 21 referred to above is accomplished in the following way.<br />(35) With the determination of a given cockpit configuration and a suitable assembly of cathode ray tube 17 and collimating optical system 19 the principal parameter values concerned with the design of the prism assembly are already settled; namely, the zone of permitted head motion of the pilot, the distance of that zone from the porthole 20 of the optical system 19, and the position of the windshield frame 55. Hence in the FIG. 6 the values of the dimension D (outside diameter of casing 16 around the porthole 20. L (distance of the front face 23 of the prism assembly from the eye), X (maximum transverse displacement of the eye E.sub.L from the longitudinal optical axis 15), and .mu. (the refractive index of the prism glass to be used) are all predetermined. Furthermore, the prism assembly is to be symmetrical about the longitudinal optical axis 15.<br />(36) The free front face 27 of the central triangular prism 26 is given a width just greater than D.<br />(37) The limiting ray passing along the path 93 and reflected at the front edges of the inner and outer faces I.sub.R and O.sub.R determines the inclination of those faces relative to the free face 27, since the respective angles of incidence of the path at the two points of reflection are equal to the respective angles of reflection. This completely determines the dimensions and angles of the central prism 26, since the point 30 of intersection of the two inner faces I.sub.R and I.sub.L lies on the longitudinal optical axis 15, and the spacing of the outer faces O.sub.R and O.sub.L from the respective faces I.sub.R and I.sub.L.<br />(38) The position of the rear plane face 22 of the prism assembly is then determined by the path 94 of the limiting ray which just skirts the side of the casing 16 (in which the cathode ray tube and collimating optical system are enclosed) and which is seen just as the eye E.sub.L scans the edge of the inner face I.sub.L which meets with the adjacent edge of the inner face I.sub.R. The point of reflection of this ray on the outer face O.sub.L determines the position of the intersection of the rear face 22 with the outer faces O.sub.L and O.sub.R.<br />(39) Similar considerations apply in respect of the prism assembly shown in the FIG. 7.<br />(40) In accordance with the normal practice the collimating optical unit 19 provides a virtual image of the circular screen 18 of the cathode ray tube 17, which image appears to the pilot as if it is an infinite distance, and which image subtends at the pilot's eye a cone angle of for example 20.degree.. Since there is a severe lack of space in front of the pilot it is not possible to provide in front of him a porthole 20 which is great enough to encompass the whole of the 20.degree. cone necessary for an instantaneous vision of the whole of the image of the cathode ray tube screen. Therefore, a similar instantaneous field of view, as given by a smaller porthole, has to be accepted. Thus, the pilot is required to move his head from position to position so as to scan different fields of the screen image as he requires to see different pieces of information displayed at those parts.<br />(41) The nearer the porthole is to the pilot, the greater is the instantaneous field of the screen image that he can see.<br />(42) In the present case the porthole is situated at the minimum possible distance from the aforesaid zone of acceptable pilot eye positions, so that the instantaneous field of view of the screen in relation to the size of the porthole is substantially greater than that in prior art HUD display units. Thus the amount of movement of the pilot's head to gain a total view of the screen image is greatly reduced.<br />(43) This is illustrated in the FIGS. 10 and 11.<br />(44) In FIG. 10 there is shown to the rear of the windshield 12 a conventional combiner screen 73 and collimator porthole optic 74 of a typical prior art head-up display unit. The virtual position of the porthole optic (lens) is shown in dotted lines at 75, and the instantaneous field of view of this at the design eye position shown is designated by the arrow 76 extending between upper and lower boundary lines 77, 78.<br />(45) The total field of view available to the eye by upward and downward movement respectively is designated by the arrow 79 extending between the lower boundary line 80 of the high eye position 81 and the upper boundary line 82 of the low eye position 83.<br />(46) In FIG. 11, the various fields of view obtainable with such a typical prior art arrangement are indicated in the right hand figure, where the perimeter of the 20.degree. cone-angle collimated image of the cathode ray tube screen 18 is shown by the circle 84. The shaded area 85 represents the instantaneous field of view corresponding to the size of the angle 76 in FIG. 10 at the design eye position.<br />(47) Dropping the eyes 21/2 in. below the design eye position raises the instantaneous field of view to an upper position in which its upper boundary lies at 86, whilst raising the eyes 1/2 inch above the design eye position drops the instantaneous field of view to a lower position at which its lower boundary lies at 87. Thus a vertical change in eye position of 3 inches produces a total observable field of view lying between the upper and lower boundaries shown at 86 and 87. These fields of view are obtainable with a 5 inches diameter porthole optic.<br />(48) By way of comparison, there is shown in FIG. 10 the porthole optic 20 and prism assembly 21 of a head up display unit based on the arrangement shown in the FIGS. 4, 5, the porthole optic 20 being of such diameter as to subtend the same cone angle 76 of instantaneous field of view at the pilot's eye.<br />(49) It will be observed that since the porthole optic 20 is much nearer the pilot's eye, the angle of the total field of view that can be observed by movement of the eye between the positions 81 and 83 is that indicated by the arrow 88. It will also be observed that this angle 88 is much greater than the corresponding angle 79, despite the fact that the porthole optic 20 is much smaller than the optic 74 of the prior art display unit.<br />(50) Thus for a porthole optic 20 of diameter greater than that indicated in FIG. 10 a much greater instantaneous field of view is obtainable, so that still less vertical movement of the eye is required to cover the total vertical extent of the cathode ray tube screen image. This is demonstrated in the left hand figure of FIG. 11, where the various fields of view shown are applicable to a porthole optic of 4 inches diameter and which has been trimmed at its sides so as to have a width between parallel vertical side edges of 23/4 inches.<br />(51) The instantaneous field of view at the design eye position is shown by the shaded area 89. Dropping the eyes 1/2 inch below the design eye position raises the instantaneous field of view to a position in which its upper boundary lies at 90, whilst raising the eyes by 11/2 inches below the design eye position drops the instantaneous field of view to a lower position at which its lower boundary lies at 91. Thus a vertical change in the eye position of 2 inches produces a total observable field of view lying between the upper and lower boundaries shown at 90 and 91.<br />(52) Thus with a porthole optic substantially smaller than that of the prior art unit, the display unit according to the present invention offers a substantially greater observable field of view with substantially less vertical movement of the eye.<br />(53) FIG. 12 shows pictorially the pilot seated in the aircraft cockpit and observing the scene ahead. Flying across that scene is an aeroplane, and the cathode ray tube screen carries a display in the form of a pair of vertical side scales and between them a line interrupted by a circle. A representation of what the pilot sees when looking into the display unit prism assembly 21 is shown at 92.<br />(54) FIG. 13 shows pictorially one practical embodiment of a head-up display unit using the arrangement shown in the FIGS. 4 to 6. In this embodiment, however, the cathode ray tube is disposed on an axis which is parallel with and below the longitudinal optical axis 15, and the luminous signals produced on the screen 18 of the cathode ray tube are reflected by an arrangement of prisms in the collimating optical unit so as to be visible through the porthole 20 which is situated directly adjacent the central prism of the prism assembly 21. Whereas the prism assembly has a width (measured normal to the vertical longitudinal central plane) of some 23 cm, the collimating unit adjacent that assembly has a width of some 71/2 cm. Beneath the cathode ray tube, the housing 16 enclosing the associated electrical apparatus has a width of some 18 cm. This display unit has an approximate weight of some 10 kilograms, which is one half or less of the weight of comparable prior art display units.<br />(55) By dropping the cathode ray tube 17 below the longitudinal optical axis 15 as in the arrangement of FIG. 13, or as in an arrangement similar to that of the FIG. 8 but having the cathode ray tube 62 only, the forward length of the view-obstructing part of the casing 16 is greatly reduced, so that a more advantageous design of prism assembly 21 and a better field of view of the scene ahead is possible.<br />(56) FIG. 14 shows in comparison with one another the outlines, in side view, of the unit shown in the FIG. 13 and of a typical and comparable conventional prior art head-up display unit. It will be observed that the unit of FIG. 13 occupies considerably less space below the level of the porthole 20.<br />(57) In the various prism assemblies 21 referred to in the above description the inner optical faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L may be so arranged that in each such face only a central part thereof through which signals visible at the porthole are to be observed in rendered capable of transmitting light from the porthole and from the adjacent outer optical face, boundary areas of that face which adjoin the central part being made fully reflecting to light received from the adjacent outer optical face.<br />(58) In designing the various prism assemblies 21 described earlier, the faces which have to transmit light from the porthole and reflect light from an adjacent outer optical face are made approximately 15 to 20 per cent transmissive and 80 to 65 per cent reflective.<br />(59) It will be appreciated that though in discussing FIG. 11 no mention has been made of the effect of sideways movement of the pilot's head, such movement shifts the respective shaded area sideways. Such sideways movement of the head does not present the designer of display units with problems as difficult to solve as those which arise in accommodating vertical movement of the pilot's head.<br />(60) Though in general the various head-up display units described are concerned with observing a distant scene ahead of the pilot, so that the outer optical faces O.sub.R, O.sub.L are to all intents and purposes parallel with the inner optical faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L, if in another field of application such a head-up display unit is intended to give the observer a view of a nearer scene ahead the outer optical faces O.sub.R, O.sub.L are rotated inwardly through an appropriate small angle so that they are not longer exactly parallel with the inner optical faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L, and so that a reflected ray seen by the observer at the edge of an inner optical face disposed adjacent the porthole originates from a point in the scene ahead which lies immediately adjacent a point in that scene which is seen by the observer directly through the prism at a point immediately adjacent that edge. For example, to observe a scene approximately 7 meters ahead the outer optical faces must be rotated inwardly by approximately one half degree.<br />(61) The design of the various prism assemblies 21 described above may be varied to suit a particular application by varying the refractive index .mu. of the glass used for the prisms. Furthermore, the inclination of the outer optical surfaces O.sub.R, O.sub.L may be varied slightly to compensate for the optical properties of the particular windshield 12.<br />(62) In preferred form of the various prism assemblies 21 the upper and lower faces 24, 25, at which the inner and outer optical faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L and O.sub.R, O.sub.L terminate, are made divergent in the direction of the porthole 20 (i.e. convergent towards the pilot's eyes) so as to present less obstruction of the pilot's view when his gaze crosses the upper and lower boundaries of his field of view through the prism assembly. This preferred feature is illustrated in the FIG. 14 at 95 and 96.<br />(63) Though in the various display units described above the luminous signal source has been constituted by the screen of a cathode ray tube, other forms of luminous signal source may be used instead, e.g. liquid crystal sources; luminous diode sources; illuminated graticules, and laser and holographic devices. Furthermore, static signal sources (i.e. in which the signals displayed are constant) may be used either alone or in conjunction with a dynamic signal source (e.g. a cathode ray tube). For example, a static signal source (e.g. an illuminated graticule) may replace the second cathode ray tube 62 in the FIG. 8.<br />(64) In general, head-up display units are intended to provide for the pilot or other observer a display of luminous signals which appears to his eyes as if at the same or a similar distance as the scene which he wishes to observe ahead of him, so that in moving his gaze to observe the display he does not have to change the focus of his eyes.<br />(65) The collimating optical unit is therefore intended to provide such a display of luminous signals.<br />(66) Thus, if a head-up display unit is intended to be used in a simulator where the scene ahead lies at a distance of, say, only seven meters (as referred to above), the collimating optical unit is intended to produce a collimated image of the display of luminous signals, which image appears to the observer's eyes at a distance of only seven meters. Thus, in this specification the term `collimating optical unit` is to be construed as an optical unit for producing for an observer looking into the porthole of the unit a virtual image which appears at a distance beyond the porthole and which is large compared with the diameter of the porthole.<br />(67) Though the various head-up display units described above all incorporate collimating optical units, other head-up display units generally similar to those described above but not incorporating a collimating signal unit may be used in appropriate circumstances where the need to avoid a change in the focus of the observer's eyes when looking at the display of luminous signals is not so important. In such a modified unit the luminous signal source may be disposed adjacent the free surface 27 of the central triangular prism 26, i.e. adjacent the inner optical faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L. The luminous signal source may in such a case comprise, for example, the luminous dial of a stop watch.<br />(68) Though in the above description the head-up display units and systems have been described in relation to their use by a pilot in an aircraft, similar head-up display units may be used by other `observers` present in an aircraft at other positions.<br />(69) Furthermore, such head-up display units may be used in other contexts, for example in a military tank, or in a naval vessel, where a display of luminous signals is required to be shown in superposed relationship with a view of a scene lying ahead or of a scene outside an enclosure in which an observer is present.<br />(70) Though in the various head-up display units described above the plane optical faces I.sub.R, I.sub.L and O.sub.R, O.sub.L have been provided on supporting means constituted by glass prisms, in other forms of head-up display units which are generally similar, those faces are provided with other forms of supporting means, e.g. plane plates of glass (silvered and partly silvered as appropriate). However, supporting means in the form of glass prisms are preferred since they provide a more robust, stable and accurate form of supporting means. Furthermore the glass prisms shorten the optical paths of the light rays passing to the observer's eye."

such a rotation makes it possible to evacuate the cartridge, simultaneously with the loading of an ammunition inside firing chamber 12 by a loading mechanism.<br />[0026] Such a system for evacuating cartridges further comprises a safety mechanism adapted to move tray 2 in the case in which movement mechanism 3 malfunctions.<br />[0027] Such a safety mechanism prevents onset of damage consequent upon the impact of tray 2 with the loading mechanism, adapted to insert new ammunition into firing chamber 12.<br />[0028] Tray 2 is preferably circular-shaped, with dimensions such as to receive the cartridges from firearm 1, and during its rotation about axis &quot;X&quot; it can take up three different positions, as illustrated in FIG. 4.<br />[0029] In position &quot;A&quot; tray 2 is aligned with the axis of barrel 13 of firearm 1, waiting to receive the cartridge.<br />[0030] Position &quot;B&quot;, defined as the safety position, is the position that tray 2 takes up in the case in which movement mechanism 3 malfunctions.<br />[0031] Said position &quot;B&quot; is also the intermediate position before returning into position &quot;A&quot;.<br />[0032] Position &quot;C&quot; is the position that tray 2 takes up when it must be cleared of the cartridge it contained by an expulsion mechanism 5.<br />[0033] Once the cartridge has been expelled, tray 2 returns to the position &quot;A&quot; so as to receive a further cartridge.<br />[0034] As mentioned above, when passing from position &quot;C&quot; to position &quot;A&quot;, tray 2 can, for example, stop in position &quot;B&quot; in the case in which the loading mechanism has not yet finished its operations, averting the possibility of collisions between the parts involved, to then return to position &quot;A&quot; once the loading mechanism has been disengaged.<br />[0035] As mentioned above, the rotary movement of tray 2 occurs around axis &quot;X&quot; through a hooking portion 21, preferably U-shaped,  comprised in such a tray 2, which is hinged to a pin 111.<br />[0036] Such a pin 111 is fixed to box-shaped structure 11 through a support flange 112.<br />[0037] The movement of tray 2 is carried out by movement mechanism which comprises a double acting movement actuator 31, preferably hydraulic, dedicated to tray 2, which acts upon tray 2 itself, via a gear mechanism 32.<br />[0038] The movements of tray 2 can be synchronised, with the rest of the mechanisms implemented in firearm 1, in a preset and appropriately cadenced way from a first position &quot;A&quot;, where the cartridge is received, to a second position &quot;C&quot;, in which the cartridge is expelled by an expulsion mechanism 5, and vice versa.<br />[0039] In normal operation conditions of the evacuation system, when tray 2 receives the cartridge it is received inside tray 2 itself.<br />[0040] Said tray 2 must respect a certain distance from firing chamber 12 so as to avoid impacts during the recoil of firearm 1 following upon deflagration of the ammunition.<br />[0041] The position of tray 2 with respect to firing chamber 12, from which the cartridge comes, varies according to the angle of inclination of firearm 1.<br />[0042] The cartridge extracted from such a chamber 12 undergoes the effect of gravity differently according to the angle of inclination of firearm 1, and therefore tray 2 will be positioned correctly so as to be able to always receive the cartridge.<br />[0043] Tray 2 comprises a cartridge-retention device 22 and a braking device 23.<br />[0044] The cartridge arrives inside tray 2 with a certain speed suitable for the correct insertion into tray 2.<br />[0045] In the embodiment described, such a speed is moreover exploited so as to activate cartridge-retention device 22 which generates a signal of receiving the cartridge when the latter is inside tray 2.<br />[0046] In the illustrated embodiment, given as an example and not for limiting purposes, the cartridge is inserted inside tray 2 exploiting the recoil of firing chamber 12 consequent to the deflagration of the ammunition.<br />[0047] The receiving signal is received by a control device, which is suitable for controlling and activating the systems, mechanisms and devices present in firearm 1, which will activate movement mechanism 3.<br />[0048] Such a cartridge-retention device 22 comprises a contact portion 221 with the cartridge, adapted to detect the presence of the cartridge itself inside tray 2, sending the receiving signal to the control device.<br />[0049] In the following embodiment contact portion 221 is preferably a metallic element that is hinged so as to rotate around an axis, which is preferably perpendicular with respect to the longitudinal axis of the cartridge inserted in tray 2.<br />[0050] The rotation of contact portion 221, through a first lever mechanism, activates such a retention device 22, which transmits the signal of received cartridge to the control device.<br />[0051] Braking device 23 is adapted to slow down the cartridge, from firing chamber 12, in its insertion inside tray 2, preferably after sending the receiving signal towards the control device by cartridge-retention device 22.<br />[0052] Such a braking device 23 makes it possible to avoid collisions between the cartridge and the bottom of tray 2, in any case allowing retention device 22 to detect the presence of the cartridge inside tray 2.<br />[0053] In embodiment illustrated in FIG. 6B, braking device 23 preferably comprises a contact plate 231, a second lever mechanism 232, connected to a damper 233.<br />[0054] Said plate 231, rotating around a pin with an axis that is preferably perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cartridge, comes into contact with the bottom of the cartridge and thanks to the lever mechanism, connected to damper 233, it slows down the cartridge.<br />[0055] A buffer 25, for example in rubber, is applied to the bottom of tray 2, said buffer being adapted to soften impacts of the cartridges if they have not been sufficiently slowed down by braking device 23.<br />[0056] When the receiving signal is received by the control device it activates movement mechanism 3, in a way such as to pass from position &quot;A&quot; to position &quot;C&quot; passing by position &quot;B&quot;, which is preferably about half way between the other two positions.<br />[0057] With such a system, the firing frequency of firearm 1 is increased, since the different shooting steps of firearm 1 are carried out almost simultaneously.<br />[0058] In the illustrated embodiment, position &quot;C&quot; is preferably at a rotation of about 130.degree. of tray 2 with respect to position &quot;A&quot;; consequently, position &quot;B&quot; is preferably at a rotation of about 60.degree. of tray 2 with respect to position &quot;A&quot;.<br />[0059] The movement of movement mechanism 3, on tray 2, is preferably decelerated when approaching stroke end, more precisely when approaching position &quot;A&quot; and in position &quot;C&quot;, so as to avoid impact between parts, and so as to reduce oscillations of tray 2.<br />[0060] Such oscillations would be harmful, since they could propagate to the devices interacting with the evacuation system, making the system less stable.<br />[0061] Tray 2, once it has reached position &quot;C&quot;, is freed from the cartridge that was previously contained in the tray itself, by expulsion mechanism 5, which comprises a rigid tube 51, adapted to channel the cartridge to be expelled, at least an expulsion actuator 52, preferably hydraulic, adapted to thrust the cartridge from tray 2 towards tube 51, through at least one thrust portion 521 comprised in actuator 52 itself.<br />[0062] Rigid tube 51 is preferably fixed above breech 14 so as to not get in the way of the various devices comprised in the firearm.<br />[0063] Said actuator 52 is placed in a position such as to not get in the way of the rotation of tray 2, preferably parallel to tube 51. It is supported above tray 2 through at least one support rod 54 preferably fixed both to tube 51 and to box-shaped structure 11.<br />[0064] Thrust portion 521, also positioned so as to not get in the way of the movement of tray 2, is fixed both to actuator 52 and to at least one sliding block 522 adapted to slide along a guide together with such a portion 521, along the support rod 54 when actuator 52 is activated.<br />[0065] When tray 2 is in position &quot;C&quot;, aligned with tube 51, a signal for the expulsion positioning reaches the control device.<br />[0066] Once the control device has received the positioning signal, it activates actuator 52, which is in the point of maximum extension, moving portion 521, which is channelled in a slit 24 in tray 2.<br />[0067] Such a slit 24 is preferably formed along the entire length of tray 2, so as to allow thrust portion 521 to expel the cartridge from tray 2 itself more easily.<br />[0068] said portion 521 presses against the bottom of the cartridge thrusting it from tray 2 towards tube 51.<br />[0069] Expulsion mechanism 5 also comprises a further anti-return device 53, which activates in the case in which the thrust of actuator 52 on the cartridge is not enough to thrust it beyond tube 51.<br />[0070] said device 53 consists of a lock portion 531, which is placed inside tube 51 in the case in which the cartridge returns towards tray 2, because the thrust from actuator 52 was not strong enough to make it come out from tube 51.<br />[0071] Said device is advantageous in the case in which firearm 1 is at a high angle of inclination, in which the thrust of actuator 52 can be insufficient for the cartridge to pass beyond tube 51.<br />[0072] When the cartridge is expelled from th tray 2, the control device receives a signal of successful expulsion in this way giving tray 2 consent to return to position &quot;A&quot; so as to receive another cartridge.<br />[0073] The control device activates movement mechanism 3 so as to pass from position &quot;C&quot; to the position &quot;A&quot; passing by position &quot;B&quot;.<br />[0074] When passing from the second position (C) to the first position (A) of tray 2, the control device, in the case in which the loading mechanism is still performing its operating steps, makes it possible for the loading mechanism to terminate its operating steps, before allowing movement mechanism 3 to make tray 2 return, to the first position (A), so as to receive a new cartridge.<br />[0075] In the following embodiment, before reaching position &quot;A&quot;, in the aforementioned case, movement mechanism 3 is slowed down, once position &quot;B&quot; has been reached, by means of a bypass valve.<br />[0076] The movement from position &quot;C&quot; towards position &quot;A&quot; of tray is slowed down as much as possible allowing the loading mechanism to terminate its operating steps without causing interference or impacts between the various mechanisms.<br />[0077] The slowing down of the descent preferably occurs by reducing the pressure in an oleodynamic circuit connected to actuator 31 by opening the bypass valve.<br />[0078] A further embodiment foresees for example stopping tray 2 in position &quot;B&quot;, staying in position &quot;B&quot; until the control device receives the signal of end of loading, from the loading mechanism.<br />[0079] Once such a command has been received, the control device activates movement mechanism 3 so as to bring tray 2 from position &quot;B&quot; towards position &quot;A&quot;.<br />[0080] In the case in which movement mechanism 3 fails to operate the system for evacuating cartridges comprises a safety mechanism which is adapted to free tray 2, in position &quot;A&quot;, from the resistance that actuator 31, by not operating, exerts on such a tray 2 making the movement of such a tray 2 idle around pin 111.<br />[0081] Said solution prevents such a tray 2 from getting in the way of the loading mechanism when new ammunition is to be loaded in firearm 1.<br />[0082] Said safety mechanism comprises at least one relief valve connected to the oleodynamic circuit that controls actuator 31.<br />[0083] Such a relief valve, preferably a maximum pressure valve, is activated only in the case in which the loading mechanism reaches a certain operating step without such a tray 2 being moved from position &quot;A&quot;.<br />[0084] Going into details, when the loading mechanism presses against tray 2, the relief valve opens due to the increase in pressure inside the oleodynamic circuit of actuator 31 that opposes such a movement of tray 2.<br />[0085] The relief valve is opened, emptying out the oleodynamic circuit of actuator 31, since the limit pressure of such a valve is exceeded, preferably 20 Bar.<br />[0086] Once such a valve has been opened the oleodynamic circuit of actuator 31 is discharged making tray 2 idle in the movement around pin 111.<br />[0087] The operating steps of the loading mechanism, in the aforementioned case, do not stop but rather continue loading new ammunition.<br />[0088] In such a situation, tray 2 is physically moved, for example to position &quot;B&quot;, by the structure of the loading mechanism, since tray 2 is free to move.<br />[0089] Tray 2 is kept in such a position until the loading mechanism terminates its operating steps after which tray 2 goes back down into position &quot;A&quot; since it is still idle.<br />[0090] After the projectile has been loaded in such a condition an alarm is activated by the control circuit which indicates malfunctioning of mechanism 3, the emptying out of the oleodynamic circuit of actuator 31 and the idle movement of tray 2.<br />[0091] Said solution makes it possible to move for example tray 2 into position &quot;B&quot; without causing irreparable damage due to the impact between mechanisms.<br />[0092] In alternative embodiments a safety actuator is also comprised which, connected to an oleodynamic circuit, moves tray 2, for example to position &quot;C&quot; or position &quot;B&quot;, in the case of malfunctioning of movement mechanism 3, after the relief valve has released tray 2, exploiting for example part of the power of the loading mechanism.<br />[0093] With such a system for evacuating cartridges it is possible to increase the firing frequency of a firearm 1, since the step of evacuating the cartridge from firing chamber 12 is carried out almost simultaneously with the step of loading new ammunition by the loading mechanism.<br />[0094] With such an evacuation system, the step of loading a new projectile occurs with a very slight delay that corresponds to the time it takes the cartridge to come out summed to the time it takes tray 2 to reach position &quot;B&quot;, since after such a position the system for evacuating cartridges does not get in the way of the loading mechanism.<br />REFERENCE NUMBERS<br />  [0095] Firearm 1 [0096] Box-shaped structure 11 [0097] Pin 111 [0098] Support flange 112 [0099] Firing chamber 12 [0100] Barrel 13 [0101] Breech 14 [0102] Tray 2 [0103] Hooking portion 21 [0104] Cartridge-retention device 22 [0105] Contact portion 221 [0106] Braking device 23 [0107] Contact plate 231 [0108] Lever mechanism 232 [0109] Damper 233 [0110] Slit 24 [0111] Buffer 25 [0112] Movement mechanism 3 [0113] Movement actuator 31 [0114] Gear mechanism 32 [0115] Cartridge expulsion mechanism 5 [0116] Rigid tube 51 [0117] Expulsion actuator 52 [0118] Thrust portion 521 [0119] Sliding blocks 522 [0120] Anti-return device 53 [0121] Lock portion 531 [0122] Support rod 54 [0123] Position A [0124] Position B [0125] Position C [0126] Axis X"

The general principles defined in the following description would be applied to other embodiments, alternatives, modifications, equivalents, and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br />(12) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref> of the drawings, a sight device according to a first preferred embodiment of the present invention is illustrated, wherein the sight device is adapted for detachably mounting on a firearm, especially on top of a rifle, having a bore axis. Accordingly, the sight device of the present invention comprises a mounting base <b>10</b>, a sight unit <b>20</b>, and a sight arrangement.<br />(13) The mounting base <b>10</b> comprises an attachment arrangement <b>11</b> provided at a bottom side of the mounting base <b>10</b> for detachably attaching onto the firearm. The mounting arrangement <b>11</b> can be configured to have a “Weaver” mounting structure, a “Picatinny” mounting structure, or “KeyMod” mounting structure to detachably couple at the firearm.

Preferably, the mounting base <b>10</b> has a low profile design to be mounted on the firearm. Furthermore, the mounting base <b>10</b> has two sidewalls defining as a thumb side <b>12</b> and a finger side <b>13</b>. When the operator hands on the firearm, such as the handguard of the rifle, the thumb of the operator can reach the thumb side <b>12</b> of the mounting base <b>10</b> while the fingers of the operator can reach the finger side <b>13</b> of the mounting base <b>10</b>.<br />(14) The sight unit <b>20</b>, according to the first embodiment, is a reflex optic, wherein the sight unit <b>20</b> comprises a lens housing <b>21</b> upwardly extended from a top platform of the mounting base <b>10</b>, an enlarged optic window <b>22</b> supported in the lens housing <b>21</b> for allowing the operator a wide field of view, and a sight luminous element <b>23</b> for generating a reflex optic dot on the optic window <b>22</b>.<br />(15) Accordingly, the lens housing <b>21</b> has an elongated structure having an objective end and a sight end, and defining a sight axis <b>211</b> parallel to the bore axis of the firearm.

Movable along the track are projectile-carrying trolleys 6 having wheels 7 and guide rollers 71.<br />(15) Sustained by ball bearings 5 for rotation relatively to the track is a toothed ring en-12 gaged by a driving pinion 9 on a shaft 10, the shaft being journalled in bearings on the platform 11 if the ring 4 is exterior to the track (as in Figs. 1 and 2), or mounted in the turret trunk (see Figs. 2, 4, 5 and 6) cat if the ring 4 is interior to the track, On the upper edge of the ring 4 are teeth 12. On the underside of each trolley is pivoted oil the fulcrum pin 16 a lever 15 at the end( oi'<br />(16) one arm of which is a clog 13 cushioned by 0 the spring 14 and engageable in any of the interdental spaces of the upper edge of the ring -4. On the end of the other arm of the lever 15 is a follower or roller 17 which engages with a cam track 18 carried by a NO 1 second lever 19 which is piv~otedl at one end to the under side of the trolley. An an- coupling and arresting lever or ""bolt"" 20 at the end of which is a stop finger 21 is pivoted within the turret trunk 3 adjacent 1(15 to the loading hatch 22 in such position that movement of the lever 20 about its pivot causes the finger 21 to enter, or be withdrawn from the path of the trolley, so that when entered into the path of the trolley 1I the finger 21 will be encountered by the free end of the lever 19 as the trolley moves around the track. The lever 20 carries, in addition to the finger 21, a spring-urged catch 23 which is adapted to enter into engagement with a notched plate 24 secured to the underside of the trolley. A lever 2-5, pivoted at one end to the fulcrum pin 163 of the lever 15, has a lug 26 the curved face of which is held in rolling contact with the face of a similar lug 27 on the lever 19 by a link 28. A second uncoupling and arrest- iug lever 29 similar to the lever 20 is pivotally mounted at the loading platform 11 (for the sake of convenience this lever 29 is shown in Fig. 4 as being in action simultaneously with the lever 20 although this could not occur in pr'actice owing to the limits imposed by the, training angle 0, see Fig.<br />(17) 2). This lever 29 has at its end a fina er' 30 adapted to be encountered by the free end 20) of the lever 25 and also carries a spring- urged catch 31 adapted to enter into engagement with a notched plate 32 on the trolley. Towards the rear of the trolley is fitted[ a spring, buffer 33 the plunger 341 of 23 which is adapted to engage the rear edge of the lever 25. Extending beyond the trolley in a forward direction is an endwise mov- ab~le plunger 35 bearing against the fore edge of the lever 19.<br />(18) In operation, the shaft 10 carrying the pinion 9 in mesh with the teeth 8 on the ring 4 is driven continuously by any convenient means, imparting continuous rotary motion to the ring, 4. When the dog 13 3&gt; enters one of the interdental spaces in the upper edge of the ring 4, the trolley is engaged with the ring and propelled along, the track. For the purpose of this explanation assume that the trolley is mnoving in the direction indicated by the arrow in Fig.<br />(19) 4 and is approaching the turret hatch.<br />(20) When the trolley arrives at that part of the track immediately opposite the turret hatch, the free end of the lever: 19 encounters the finger 21 and the lever 19 is moved angul- larly about its pivot. During the motion of the lever 19 the cam track 18 moves relatively to the roller 17 carried by the lever 15, causing the lever 15 to move through a small angle about its fulcrum pin 16, and thereby withdrawing the dog 13 from the interdental space in the rotating ring 4.<br />(21) The angular motion of the lever 19 is transmitted to the lever 25 through the interac- io of the lugs 26 and 27. The spring buffer 33 now comes into action, absorbing the. energy of motion of the trolley and brin~xing the latter to rest opposite the hatch 22. Meanwhile the notched plate 24, being opposite the catch 23, is engaged by the catch so that the trolley is held against the reaction of the buffer 33. When thie trolley has delivered its load, the lever 20 is withdrawn to remove the finger 21 from 0 the pathi of the lever 14D and to reic ase the catch 23 from the notched plate 24. The reaction of the spring buffer 33 now comes into operation, imparting reverse angular movements to the levers 25, 19 and 15, thereby causing the dog 13 to enter an interdental space in the rotating ring 4 which hauls the trolley along the track towards the loading platform 11. The buffer spring 14 interposed between the dog 13 and the lever 15 serves to absorb shock due to the sudden restart of the trolley. When the trolley arrives at the loading platform 11, the lever 29 comes into action. The function of this lever 29 is similar to that of the lever 20 at the turret hatch, the impact 51 of the free end of the lever 25 with the finger 30 causing motion of the lever 25 which is transmitted to the lever 19 by the link 28, whereby the dlog 13 is withdrawn from engagement with the ring 4 as hereinbefore described, the spring buffer 33 absorbing the energy of motion of the trolley and the spring catch, 31 engaging the notched plate 32 to hold the trolley against the reaction of the buffer. When the trolley has received its load, the lever 29 is withdrawn. The reaction of the buffer 33 causes the dlog 13 to re-enter into engagement with the ring 4 which again hauls the trolley along the track. In the event of a collision 9'<br />(22) between trolleys when two or more are on the track at one and the same time the plunger 35 extending forwardly from the overtaking trolley receives the force of impact between the two trolleys and is thereby 10""<br />(23) caused to move endwise in a rearward direction. This motion of the plunger 35 imparts angular motion to the lever 19, thereby disengaging the dog 13 from the ring 4 as hereinbefore described. 10A The second example shown in Figs. 7 to 13 represents the application of a miodifica- tion of the invention such as may be used when the shell room hatch is at somec dis- lance from the turret trunk.<br />(24) In this example, the track, which consists of two guide rails I and 2, partly encircles the turret trunk 3 andl joins more or less devious curved paths from and to the loading platform 11 at the shell room hatch. A ring 4 concentric with the turret trunk 3 and carried by ball. bearings 5 is mounted on the track below the guide rails and is adapted to be continuously rotated by-means similar to those employed in the first ex-12 ample. Wrapped around the ring 4 and frictionally driven thereby is a flexible steel band 363 which is constrained to follow the contour of the track by the action, of a ring 4at the loading platform 11 and guide pulleys 37 located alongside the track. The body of each trolley 6 is mounted on two wheeled bogies 38 and 39 which arc pivoted on the under side of the body. The trolley is adapted to be coupled to the flexible band 30 by means of a spring-controlled frictional grjmgdevice mounted on the trolley. The gip~ing device (which is seen most clearly in Figs. 11. 12 and 13') con- l ists of two more or less resilient jaws 40 and 41. One jaw 40 is carried by a depending arm 42 on the trolley body and is adapted to bear against one side of the flexible band 36. The other jaw 41 is carried at the lower end of a lever 43 which is pivoted to the depending arm 42 and is adapted to bear against the other side of the flexible band. A spring 44 located near the upper end of the lever -13 and in adjustable comn- e; pression between the lever 43 and the arm 42 tends to mrove the lever 43 about its pivot, thus cauisng the jaws 40 and 41 to gr~ip the flexible band 36 between them. A lever 45i having a camn-faced end adapted to engage the upper end of the lever -13 is pivoted to the under side of the trolley body and is connected by a link 46 to another lever 47 pivoted at one end to the trolley body.<br />(25) Mounted on the trolley body and coacting with the levers 45 and 47 pivoted thereon is a shock-absorbing spring buffer 33, a forwardly projecting plunger 35 and a notched plate 32 the functions of wvhich will be readily understood from the description 3() of the first example. An uncoupling and arresting lever 20 functioning in like manner to the similar lever 20 in the first example is located at the turret trunk loading batch 22 and an uncoupling and arresting 3a5 bolt 20' is located at the shell room loading platform 11.<br />(26) In operation, the ring 4 is continuously rotated and drives the band 30 around the path of the track. So long as the gripping 410 dlevice is in operation, the trolley is hauled along the track. When the trolley arrives at either the loading platformti 11 or the loading hatch 22, the free end of the lever 47 encounters the uncoupling and arresting 4 5 member 20' or 20 and the lever 47 is thereby cauised to move angularly aboiit its pivot.<br />(27) This angular motion is transmitted thirou gh the link 4l6 to the lever 45 aind the caum- faced end of this lever causes the lever 43 50) to move about its pivot against the action of the spring 44, thereby relieving the pies- sure between the jaws 40 and 41 and uncoupling the trolley from the moving flexible band. The spring buffer 33 and the 55"" notched plate 32 function in like manner to the similar elements in the first example.<br />(28) On withdrawal of the member 20' or 20 the reverse motion of the levers 47, 45 and 43 allows the jaws 40 and 41 to close under the 0)) action of the spring 41 and motion is again imparted to the trolley. By altering the initial compression of the spring 44 the pressure between the jaws 40 and 41 may be so adjusted as to permit of a certain slip between the jaws and the flexible band 236 when the gripping device come; inito act ion, thus allowing the trolley to start without violent shock.<br />(29) It is to be understood that thme i eiti on in its broader aspects is not '-:aited to the Ti0 precise constructions shown since mn71 changes may be made in the forin. arraige- ment andl mode of operation of the parts, for which obvious equivalents miay be sub- stituited, without departure fromt the esseince of the invention. For example, the means of coupling the trolley or trolleys to the traction member and the means of driving the traction member may be muodifiedl."
US-4738183-A,"An improved magazine and method of its manufacture particularly designed for a specific gun/magazine system. The invention also pertains to the plastic molding arts in general. A magazine is provided having numerous features and advantages including means to permit assembly and disassembly using no tools or screw threaded fasteners or rivets or the like, viewing windows, and based upon symmetrical clam shell type halves having internal features necessary for proper functioning of the magazine.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />FIG. 1 is a side elevational view of the gun/magazine system of the invention of our prior co-pending application and which also shows the use of the improved magazine of the present invention;<br />FIG. 2 is a partial exploded view showing the magazine removed from the gun of FIG. 1;<br />FIG. 3 is a view similar to FIG. 2 but showing only one half of the housing of the magazine according to the present invention; and<br />FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 are cross-sectional views taken on cutting lines 4--4, 5--5 and 6--6 of FIG. 2 respectively.<br />(1) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br />(2) FIG. 1 shows a gun G carrying a magazine 10. The gun G may be the same gun described and claimed in our prior co-pending application. The magazine 10 is, functionally, the same as the magazine of that prior application, the improvement of the present invention residing primarily in its construction and manner of manufacture.<br />(3) Various parts of the gun including the manner in which it cooperates with the magazine of that disclosure as well as with the invention magazine, do not form a material part of the present invention. Reference may be had to that prior application for details.<br />(4) The magazine 10 includes numerous internal working parts, the winder 12 of which is shown in FIG. 2. Here again, these magazine working parts do not form a material part of the present invention, and reference may be had to our prior co-pending application for more details as to that aspect.<br />(5) FIG. 3 shows the right clam shell half 14, the symmetrical left clam shell half 16 being shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.<br />(6) It is of course to be understood and is clear from the drawings that the two halves 14 and 16 are symmetrical with each other around an axial plane, and cooperate to form a continuous ammunition magazine housing, this being illustrated in FIG. 4.<br />(7) Each clam shell half 14 and 16 includes a plurality of half screw threads 18 formed on the inside surface thereof. As is clear from FIG. 4, the screw thread halves 18 on both clam shell halves 14 and 16 fit together in such a way as to form one continuous screw thread as is required by the magazine and as is disclosed and discussed in detail in our prior co-pending application.<br />(8) At the end of each screw thread half 18 is provided either a pin 20 or a mating opening 22. The pins and openings 20 and 22 are tapered as is shown in FIG. 4 to aid in location and to provide a tight fit between the halves 14 and 16. Further, the magazine is of substantially elongated configuration, in the particular embodiment shown in FIG. 3, eight turns are provided, and thus there are sixteen pairs of mating pins holes of 20 and 22. This substantial number of pairs of pins and openings provides a great deal of dimensional integrity and a tight secure fit between the two halves 14 and 16.<br />(9) Each clam shell half 14 and 16 is provided with a pair of half window openings 24, and with a half securing slot 26. When the parts fit together, a full window opening as shown in FIG. 5 is provided and a full slot to receive the securing fingers of the clips as shown in FIG. 2 is provided between the halves 24 and 26, respectively.<br />(10) As shown in the drawing, all of the pins 20 are on the right half 14, and thus, of course, all of the mating openings 22 will be provided on the left half 16. This arrangement could be modified in whatever way might be advantageous in any other environment, as is clear to those skilled in the art.<br />(11) The remaining features of each clam shell half 14 and 16 as shown in the drawings pertain to the manner of operation of the magazine in cooperation with the gun G, and thus those features need not be described in any further detail herein. Again, reference may be had to our prior co-pending application for more details in this area.<br />(12) FIG. 5 shows the halves 14 and 16 fitted together to create a complete opening made of the window half openings 24, and further shows the window 28 positioned therein and secured in place by the elongated securing clip 30. The window itself may be simply molded from any suitable clear plastic, and it is provided with a protective circular ridge 32 at its upper end. This ridge is of slightly larger diameter than the diameter 34 of the viewing opening in the clip 30, and thus the ridge 32 protects the lens or window 28 against scratching and the like as it might otherwise suffer in sliding the clip on and off the magazine absent the ridge 32. A mating shoulder arrangement 36 between the window and the halves 14 and 16 is provided to securely hold the window in place in cooperation with the clip 30.<br />(13) While this disclosure shows two clips 30, it may be possible, in an appropriate application, to use only one clip 30, as, for example, by providing hinge means made of interfitting fingers on the side opposite the one clip 30.<br />(14) As shown in FIGS. 2, 4, 5 and 6, the clam shell halves 14 and 16 are formed with securing means in the form of upstanding dove-tails 38 at their upper and lower edges closely adjacent the line of meeting between the halves. The elongated clips 30 are provided with edges which are turned downwardly and inwardly to grasp the dove-tails. Thus, the clips 30 are mounted and removed from the clam shell halves axially along the length of the magazine 10. This is the reason for the protective ridge 32 on the window, i.e., to protect the center viewing surface from scratching by the metal clips.<br />(15) It should be noted that the two clips 30 may be identical. Securing means are provided top and bottom, but windows are provided only at the top. Thus, the two viewing windows 34 in the clip will be non-functional in the bottom position, but this has no effect on use of the invention magazine. The advantages which flow from providing two identical clips far out weighs the provision of non-functional openings at the bottom surface of the magazine. More importantly, the bottom surface is not seen at all when the magazine is mounted on a gun.<br />(16) Means are provided to removably recure the clips 30 onto the halves 14 and 16, and to permit ready disassembly of the clips from the magazine. To this end, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, the rear end of the clips 30 are provided with a pair of punched out locking fingers 40 which depend downwardly out of the plane of the top surface of the clip and into the openings formed, top and bottom, by the mating securing slot halves 26. A small opening 42 is provided in the rear finger 40 to unlock the magazine.<br />(17) In use, after assembly of the internal working parts of the magazine not forming a part of this invention, the invention housing providing all of the necessary support and location surfaces for these working parts, the clam shell halves are fitted together over the windows 28 and with the operative parts in position, and then the two clips 30 are merely slid over the dove-tails 38 until the fingers 40 &quot;find&quot; the openings formed by the slots 26, and spring down to their natural bent position inside the slots. That is the complete assembly procedure.<br />(18) For disassembly, an implement such as a paper clip, a pen, pencil, or the like, is inserted into the opening 42 in the rear finger 50, the clip 30 is manipulated so that this rear finger 40 can be raised up out of the mating slots 26, and then the clip 30 can be slid off rearwardly, to the right in FIG. 2, from the magazine halves. After both clips are so removed, the halves 14 and 16 will readily come apart using no tools and only finger pressure and access can be had to the magazine's internal parts for repair, cleaning or whatever purpose.<br />(19) This simplicity of assembly and disassembly provides enormous advantages as to economics, ease of manufacture, and permitting repair of other work on the invention magazine in the field. That is, if an internal part of the magazine should break or fail or jam, a knowledgeable user could repair the magazine himself, in the field.<br />(20) While the invention has been described in some detail above, it is to be understood that this detailed description is by way of example only, and the protection granted is to be limited only within the spirit of the invention and the scope of the following claims."
US-8807272-B2,"A sound suppressor for firearms (such as hand guns and rifles) has a tubular body with a first end cap adjacent the barrel of the firearm, and a 5 second end cap with exhaust vents for the gases. A plurality of baffles, each having a passage for the bullet, are provided in the body intermediate the first-and-second end caps. Each baffle has a plurality of vents in the outer portion, the vents forming at least one path for the flow of the major portion of the gases through the suppressor body. By angularly offsetting the vents of adjacent baffles, the gas path(s) are made tortuous to further slow the gas flow. The baffle adjacent the first end cap can be a deflecting baffle, where the vents deflect the gases outwardly towards the body.

In this example, the suppressor 10 is attached to the muzzle 11 of the firearm 12 by bayonet couplings 13.<br />(24)  FIG. 2A shows a longitudinal cross section of the sound suppressor 10 of FIG. 1. In this example, the components of the suppressor 10 are enclosed in a body 20 which is substantially cylindrical in shape; however persons skilled in the field will appreciate that the body 20 may be of other suitable shapes including square, pentagon, hexagon, or octagon. The suppressor 10 is closed at either end by first and second end caps 211, 212, 22; and contains apertures for the passage of a bullet 23. The first end cap 21 has an attachment mechanism 24 for releasably mounting the suppressor 10 to the firearm. The first end cap 211, 212 may take different forms as further described in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B. A plurality of baffles 251, 252, 253 are placed within the body 20 between the first and second end caps 211, 212, 22, and are described in more detail below. The suppressor 10 may also contain a deflecting baffle 261, 262, 263 adjacent to the first end cap 211, 212 to direct the outward expansion of the gases in a forward direction. As illustrated in FIG. 2A, an expansion chamber 27 may be formed between the first end cap 211, 212 and the deflecting baffle 261, 262, 263. As shown in FIG. 2B, FIG. 2C and FIG. 2D, the expansion chamber 27 (located adjacent to the first end cap 211) and the deflecting baffle 263 may take different forms.<br />(25)  The first end cap 211 shown in FIG. 3A has an aperture 30 for the passage of a bullet and a screw threaded bore 31 which is arranged to be coupled to complimentary screw threads on the muzzle of a firearm. The outer edges of the first end cap 211 are defined by annular rims 32, 33, 34 wherein the distal rim 34 contains vents 35 to decrease the weight of the suppressor 10 and increase the volume of the expansion chamber (not shown) formed between the first end cap 211 and the first baffle (not shown). In this example, the first end cap 211 also contains an additional annular rim 36 for increased strength.<br />(26)  FIG. 3B illustrates an alternative version of the first end cap 212 which is especially useful for larger capacity cartridges or longer firearms. In this example, the body 20 extends rearwardly from the first end cap over a portion of the barrel of the firearm (not shown), and is closed off by an outer rim 40. A hollow cylindrical tube 41 is placed inside the body 20 to fit over the barrel of the firearm (not shown), where the length of the tube 41 may be varied to suit the particular firearm used. The distal end 42 of the first end cap 212 comprises a screw threaded bore 43 for releasable attachment to the muzzle of the firearm (not shown), and annular rims 44, 45 with vents 46 to decrease the weight of the suppressor 10 and increase the volume of the expansion chamber 27. In accordance with the previous example, the bore has additional annular rim 48 for increased strength.<br />(27)  FIG. 4A provides a side sectional view of the second end cap 22 which closes the distal end of the sound suppressor. The second end cap 22 is connected to the outer portion of the adjacent baffle (not shown) by means of a male connector 50 and comprises inwardly extending channels 51 to allow the entrance of gases from the body. The second end cap 22 comprises an aperture 52 for the passage of a bullet and an outer portion 53 with at least two diametrically opposed exhaust vents 541 for the release of gases into the atmosphere. As shown in FIG. 4B, the outer portion 53 may have more than two exhaust vents 542.<br />(28)  It would be readily apparent to persons skilled in the field that at least one of the first or second end caps 211, 212, 22 may be releasably affixed to the body 20, for example by a screw thread, to enable their removal for cleaning and/or replacing the baffles 251, 252, 253, 261, 262, 263.<br />(29)  A side view of a baffle 251 is provided in FIG. 5A, wherein the outer edges of each baffle have male 60 and female 61 connectors for engagement with adjacent baffles (not shown). Each baffle 251 also has a propellant gas deflector 62 on the leading edge, and a flat-topped hollow crown 63 which acts as a spacer. Located adjacent to the crown 63, there is an outer portion 64 which, as shown in FIG. 5B, comprises a plurality of vents 65 wherein the vents 65 in each adjacent baffle 251 are angularly offset to generate at least one tortuous path for the gases. The diameter of the outer portion 64 in each baffle 251 is substantially similar to the diameter of the body 20, thereby directing the gases through the tortuous passages defined by the vents 65. Each baffle 251 also contains an aperture 66 for the passage of a bullet, where the diameter of the aperture 66 increases at a predetermined point 67 to encourage the expansion of gases in this passage.<br />(30)  In an alternative embodiment, each baffle 251 may have an additional outer portion or rim 68 with a plurality of vents (not shown) to further slow the release of the gases and to provide additional strength.<br />(31)  FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B illustrate respective side views of an alternative version of a baffle 252 wherein the outer portion 701 and the crown 71 are manufactured as separate pieces. In this example, the outer portion 701 comprises an aperture 72 for the passage of a bullet, a propellant gas deflector 73 and a male connector 74, 75 on either side for engagement with the crown 71, deflecting baffle 261, 262, 263 and/or second end cap 22. As shown in FIG. 6C, sections of the outer portion 701 are cut-out to provide vents 76 for the passage of gases. The vents 76 in each adjacent baffle 252 are angularly offset to generate at least one tortuous passage for the gases. FIG. 6D illustrates the crown 71, being an open-ended hollow tube that acts as a spacer between the subsequent baffles 252, where the length of crown 71 may be varied to suit the particular firearm used.<br />(32)  In another embodiment, the baffle 253 may be manufactured from sheet metal which has been punched out and formed into the shape shown in FIG. 6E and FIG. 6F. In this example, the outer portion 702 is substantially circular with a plurality of vents 78 for the passage of gases.<br />(33)  FIG. 7A shows a side view of the optional deflecting baffle 261. The deflecting baffle 261 has a truncated conical shape 80 to direct the gases in a forward direction along longitudinal troughs 81 on the outer surface, and a number of vents 82 in the outer portion 83 to allow gases to enter the body. Whilst the majority of gases are deflected towards the body 20, some gases inevitably follow the passage of the bullet. Accordingly, the aperture 84 for the passage of the bullet expands mid way down 85 the deflecting baffle 26 to encourage gas expansion. The edge of the outer portion 83 of the deflecting baffle 26 adjoins the body 20 such that an expansion chamber is formed between the first end cap 211, 212 and the deflecting baffle 261. The distance between the first end cap 211, 212 and the deflecting baffle 261, and thus the volume of the expansion chamber, may be varied to suit the particular firearm used. Finally, the deflecting baffle 261 also comprises a female connector 86 for attachment to an adjacent baffle.<br />(34)  FIG. 7B and FIG. 7C show alternative embodiments of the deflecting baffle 262, 263 each having an additional outer portion or rim 832 with a plurality of vents 82 to further slow the release of the gases and provide extra strength. As illustrated, the end of the deflecting baffle 262 which is adjacent to the first end cap 21 may be substantially annular (in end view) 802 with a diameter that is approximately twice that of the bullet. In another example, the deflecting baffle 263 has an intermediate portion that is a truncated cone shape 803 with a concave profile 804 that adjoins the additional rim 832.<br />(35)  As shown in FIG. 7D, the outer portion 83 has a plurality of vents 82 for the passage of gases.<br />(36)  FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B show a side view and an end view of an alternative embodiment of a baffle 254. In this embodiment, one or more vents 90 can be substituted by an elongated slot 92 which is formed by three intersecting holes.<br />(37)  FIG. 9 shows yet another alternative embodiment of the deflecting baffle 264. As illustrated, the end of the deflecting baffle 264 which is adjacent the first end cap can have a squared edge 94 to suit larger bore firearms, or a beveled edge 96 to suit smaller bore firearms.<br />(38)  FIG. 10 shows an alternative version of the first end cap 213. In this example, the first end cap 213, and therefore the sound suppressor, can be mounted to the firearm with the use of a spanner.<br />(39)  FIG. 11A and FIG. 11B show a flash eliminator 100 which can be attached to the second end cap of the sound suppressor. In this example, the attachment mechanism includes an o-ring assembly 102 which, upon frictional contact with the sound suppressor, is compressed to allow the sound suppressor to fit into the flash eliminator 100. This arrangement is particularly useful as it allows for quick attachment and detachment of the flash eliminator. As illustrated in FIG. 11B, the outer portion 106 of the flash eliminator 100 includes vents 108 for the release of the gases, and an aperture 110 for the passage of a bullet.<br />(40)  In operational use, a bullet fired from the firearm 12 passes out of the muzzle 11, thorough, the passage 23 in the suppressor 10, and exits via the second end cap 22. The pressure from the muzzle 11 of the firearm 12 forces a major portion of the gases to enter the expansion chamber 27 provided between the first end cap 21 and the deflecting baffle 26, while a minor portion of the gases pass through the apertures in the baffles, thereby following the passage of the bullet. The truncated conical shape 80 of the deflecting baffle 26 direct the outward expansion of the gases in a forward direction, where they are released to the body 10 via vents 82 in the outer portion of the deflecting baffle 26. From the deflecting baffle 26, the gases continue to expand as they move through the tortuous paths defined by a plurality of baffles 251, 252 until they reach the second end cap 22. Here, the gases pass through vents 54 in the outer portion 53 of the second end cap 22 and are released into the atmosphere at a greatly reduced pressure and velocity, resulting in increased sound reduction.<br />(41)  The preferred embodiments describe a sound suppressor having the following advantages over the prior art:   A major portion of the propellant gases are directed away from the passage of the bullet and outwardly towards the body, where the gases are expand and move along at least one tortuous path defined by the vents in the baffles, before exiting the suppressor through the exhaust vents in the second end cap; Once the propellant gases are directed outwardly towards the body, they cannot re-enter the passage for the bullet; and The apertures in the baffles adjacent the first end cap have a diameter just greater than the diameter of the bullet, and at a predetermined position, the apertures in the baffles are of increasing diameter towards the second end cap. This encourages the minor portion of the gases following the passage of the bullet to expand.<br />(42)  Various changes and modifications may be made to the embodiments described and illustrated without departing from the present invention."

In accordance with one embodiment, a user input device includes a vertical grip member that has a trigger disposed on a forward surface thereof so that the trigger is operable by a first finger of a hand holding the grip member. A first single throw electrical switch coupled to the trigger generates signals in response to depression of the trigger.<br />[0026] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a computer mouse 100 according to an embodiment of the present invention. Computer mouse 100 includes a base member 102 that has a bottom surface 104 adapted for sliding across a surface. For example, bottom surface 104 may be substantially flat, and a low-friction material (such as Teflon pads) may be applied to portions (or all) of bottom surface 104. Base member 102 houses, in forward region 106, a tracking sensor (not shown in FIG. 1), such as an optical sensor, that detects motion of mouse 100 across a surface.<br />[0027] A grip member 110 is fixedly connected to a rearward section 112 of base member 102 and extends generally upward from base member 102. Grip member 110 is advantageously sized and shaped so that it can be held in a user's hand in a manner similar to holding a pistol grip. In this embodiment, grip member 110 includes a forward-extending trigger guard 114 designed to accommodate a user's index finger. A primary trigger 116 is positioned on the forward surface of grip member 110 inside the ring formed by trigger guard 114 and mounted in such a way that it can be depressed by the user's index finger while the user is holding grip member 110. A secondary trigger button 118 is positioned on an under surface of trigger guard 114 near where trigger guard 114 joins grip member 110. Secondary trigger button 118 is mounted in such a way that can be depressed by the user's second finger while the user is holding grip member 110. A scroll wheel 120 is rotatably mounted on the side of grip member 110 above the location of triggers 116, 118 and is disposed so as to be rotatable by the user's thumb while the user is holding grip member 110.<br />[0028] A barrel member 122 extends forward from the upper portion of grip member 110, providing a surface for attaching trigger guard 114 and giving computer mouse 100 a generally pistol-like appearance.<br />[0029] An interface cable 124, which may be, e.g., a conventional Universal Serial Bus (USB) cable, is provided to transmit mouse input signals (also referred to herein as control signals) from computer mouse 100 to a computer. The mouse input signals, which may be generally conventional in nature, advantageously include position and/or motion signals from the tracking sensor housed in forward section 106 of base member 102, as well as button or scrolling signals generated in response to user operation of triggers 116, 118 and scroll wheel 120. In one embodiment, operation of primary trigger 116 generates conventional &quot;Left Button Up/Down,&quot; or &quot;Button1 Up/Down,&quot; signals; operation of secondary trigger 118 generates conventional &quot;Right Button Up/Down,&quot; or &quot;Button2 Up/Down,&quot; signals; and operation of scroll wheel 120 generates conventional scroll wheel signals (e.g., &quot;Scroll Down,&quot; &quot;Scroll Up,&quot; &quot;Scroll Button Press,&quot; &quot;Scroll Button Release&quot;).<br />[0030] In one embodiment, base member 102, grip member 110 and barrel member 120 are formed of injection-molded plastic. Left-side and right-side sections that incorporate portions of base member 102, grip member 110 and/or barrel member 120 may be molded as unitary work pieces and, after installation of electronic and electromechanical components, may be fastened together e.g., using snap fasteners, bolts, rivets, screws, interlocking tabs and slots, and so on. In one embodiment, the sides 124 of grip member 110 may be padded with a softer material for increased user comfort and/or an esthetically pleasing appearance. Triggers 116, 118 may be made of plastic or other material (e.g., metal) as desired. Scroll wheel 120 may also be made of any material, including plastic; in one embodiment, the outer periphery of scroll wheel 120 is made of a gel-like plastic with a patterned (e.g., ribbed) surface for increased comfort and traction against the user's thumb. It will be appreciated that particular material compositions or assembly techniques are not critical to the present invention; conventional materials and manufacturing processes may be used.<br />GRIP POSITION AND ORIENTATION <br />[0031] The orientation of grip member 110 relative to base member 102 advantageously allows a user's hand to be in an ergonomically favorable vertical position while operating computer mouse 100. FIG. 2A is a simplified side view showing base member 102 resting on a surface 204, such as a table top. Grip member 110 has a major axis 206 that extends upward from a &quot;base axis&quot; 208 parallel to surface 204 at an angle .theta.. In some embodiments, angle .theta. is at least about 45.degree. and may advantageously be between about 60.degree. and 90.degree..<br />[0032] FIG. 2B is a simplified front view showing that major axis 206 of grip member 110 is oriented at an angle .phi. with respect to a transverse axis 210 parallel to surface 204. In one embodiment, angle .phi. is approximately 90.degree.; in other embodiments, angle .phi. may be somewhat smaller so that grip member 110 has an inward cant, or somewhat larger so that grip member 110 has an outward cant. Thus, major axis 206 of grip member 110 is advantageously oriented such that the user's hand is approximately vertical (i.e., the user's palm is approximately in a vertical plane) when the user holds grip 110 with mouse 100 resting on a horizontal surface 204.<br />[0033] In preferred embodiments, further ergonomic advantages may be provided by offsetting the location of the tracking sensor relative to grip member 110. FIG. 3 is a simplified side view illustrating this offset. FIG. 3 shows grip member 110 being held in a user's hand 302 (shown in outline). Major axis 206 of grip member 110 intersects bottom surface 104 of base member 102 at a &quot;grip axis location&quot; 306. A tracking sensor 308 (shown schematically as an arrow) is mounted so as to detect motion at a &quot;sensor location&quot; 310 at or near bottom surface 104 of base member 102. Sensor location 310 is offset in a forward direction from grip axis location 306 by an offset distance d that is advantageously greater than zero. In one embodiment, the offset distance d is about 8 cm; it is to be understood that distance d may be varied as desired and may be, e.g., anywhere from 0-20 cm or another distance. Use of a nonzero offset distance d advantageously provides a lever arm such that when a user moves his or her wrist such that computer mouse 110 twists or pivots about a vertical axis, an approximately linear displacement of sensor location 310 results. Thus, the user can produce mouse input signals indicating lateral movement of the mouse with a small twist of the wrist, without having to move his or her entire arm. Wrist movement can allow more precise control than an arm movement and can also reduce muscle fatigue during long periods of use such as while playing a game.<br />[0034] Further, the offset distance d can be selected to amplify small wrist movements into larger movements of a mouse-controlled cursor across the screen to a desired degree; in general, larger distances d correspond to larger amplifications. In some embodiments, the degree of amplification can also be adjusted via appropriate driver software for processing mouse input signals. Such software typically provides adjustable scaling factors for use in translating motion of the mouse across a given distance to motion of a mouse-controlled screen cursor (or pointer) across some number of screen pixels. Some operating systems provide control interfaces that allow a user to adjust this scaling factor, e.g., by modifying a &quot;pointer speed&quot; setting.<br />TRACKING SENSOR AND TRIGGERS <br />[0035] Tracking sensor 308 may be implemented using a variety of sensors, including tracking sensors known in the art. FIG. 4 is an exploded view showing one implementation of a tracking sensor according to an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, a base plate 402, which may be made, e.g., of injection-molded plastic, forms the bottom portion of base member 102. Base plate 402 has an opening 404 therein (corresponding to sensor location 310) through which light may shine. An optical tracking lens system, which may be of conventional design (e.g., an Optical Mouse lens system made by Agilent Systems of Palo Alto Calif.), is aligned with opening 404 and connected to a printed circuit board (PCB) assembly 406 that provides electronics for generating light (e.g., using an LED) and detecting motion. PCB assembly 407 may also be of conventional design (e.g., an Optical Mouse PCB assembly also made by Agilent Systems) and may also include additional components for detecting operation of the triggers and scroll wheel (described below) and for transmitting mouse input signals to a computer system, e.g., via a USB cable or wireless interface.<br />[0036] Control buttons (triggers 116, 118) for computer mouse 100 (FIG. 1) will now be described. FIG. 5A is a cross sectional view showing mounting details for triggers 116, 118 in one embodiment of computer mouse 100, and FIG. 5B is an exploded view. In this embodiment, a housing 502 (one side of which is shown) provides the outer shape of base member 102, grip member 110, trigger guard member 114 and barrel member 122.<br />[0037] Triggers 116 and 118 are mounted on respective pivotable supports (e.g., dowel pins) 504 and 506, allowing triggers 116 and 118 to be independently depressed from their resting positions by a user. Springs 508 and 510 are disposed so as to be compressed when triggers 116 and 118, respectively, are depressed and to restore triggers 116 and 118 to their resting positions upon release by the user. An electrical switch assembly 512 that includes switches 514 and 516 is disposed inside housing 502 and behind triggers 116, 118 such that switch 514 is closed when trigger 116 is depressed and switch 516 is closed when trigger 118 is depressed. Switches 514 and 516 are advantageously each implemented as a single throw switch: when a switch 514 or 516 is closed by depressing the corresponding trigger 116 or 118, current flows; when a switch 514 or 516 is open, no current flows. Switch assembly 512 may be electrically connected (e.g., via wires, not explicitly shown in FIGS. 5A-5B) to PCB assembly 408 in base unit 102 (see FIG. 4), and PCB assembly 408 may be configured to detect a &quot;Button1 Down&quot; (&quot;Button2 Down&quot;) event when current starts flowing in switch 514 (516) and a &quot;Button1 Up&quot; (&quot;Button2 Up&quot;) event when current stops flowing in switch 514 (516), and to signal such events to the computer system.<br />[0038] It will be appreciated that different triggers or buttons, mountings, and signaling elements may be substituted for those shown in FIGS. 5A-5B. For instance, magnetic trigger returns could be used in place of springs 508 and 510. Different electromechanical sensors could replace switches 514 and 516. In some embodiments, single throw switches may be replaced with multiple throw switches that enable additional features (e.g., light and/or sound effects) to be triggered when the user depresses a particular trigger or button.<br />SCROLL WHEEL <br />[0039] Scroll wheel 120 is mounted on a rotatable support 520 that includes an axis member 522. At one side of support 520 is a position encoder 524 (which may be of conventional design) that generates signals in response to rotation of support 520. At the other side is a switch 526, and support 520 is advantageously mounted such that switch 526 can be closed by depressing scroll wheel 120 laterally inward. Switch 526 is advantageously also a single-throw switch. A scroll wheel return mechanism (not explicitly shown) may also be provided to restore scroll wheel 120 to its resting position after inward pressure is released. It will be appreciated that different wheel designs, mountings, and signaling elements may be substituted for those shown.<br />[0040] Scroll wheel 120 is advantageously placed and oriented so as to be operable by a user's thumb while the user is holding grip member 110. FIG. 6 is a simplified side view showing placement and orientation of scroll wheel 120 according to an embodiment of the present invention. A user's hand 602 is shown in outline holding grip member 110. Scroll wheel 120 has an axis of rotation 604 that forms an angle .gamma. with major axis 206 of grip member 110. The position of scroll wheel 120 and the angle .gamma. are advantageously selected so that the user's thumb 606 can extend over scroll wheel 120 in approximate alignment with rotational axis 704 while the user holds grip member 110. A natural arc-like motion of thumb 606 (as indicated by double-ended arrow 608) can thus be used to rotate scroll wheel 120. In one embodiment, angle .gamma. is about 30.degree., but any angle .gamma. in the range from 0.degree. to about 90.degree. may be used. For increased comfort, a notch 610 may be provided in the back surface 612 of grip member 110.<br />[0041] It will be appreciated that while the user's hand 602 in FIG. 6 is shown as a right hand, left-handed access to scroll wheel 120 can also be provided. In preferred embodiments, scroll wheel 120 is advantageously positioned to permit access by the thumb of either hand. FIG. 7 is a back view of an embodiment of computer mouse 100 in which scroll wheel 120 can be accessed by the thumb of either hand. In this embodiment, the diameter of scroll wheel 120 is chosen such that scroll wheel 120 has exposed left and right peripheral portions 702 and 704 extending, respectively, through left and right side surfaces 706 and 708 of grip member 110. Left peripheral portion 702 would be accessible by the thumb of a user's right hand while right peripheral portion 704 would be accessible by the thumb of a user's left hand.<br />[0042] In this embodiment, scroll wheel 120 is advantageously depressible from either side. For example, two parallel-coupled switches may be provided, with one switch arranged to be closed by lateral depression of exposed left peripheral portion 702 toward major axis 206 of grip member 110 and the other switch arranged to be closed by lateral depression of exposed right peripheral portion 704 toward major axis 206 of grip member 110. Scroll wheel 120 is advantageously mounted so as to return to its resting position after the pressure from either side is released.<br />[0043] It should be noted that in this embodiment triggers 116, 118 are also operable by either hand as a result of their placement as shown in FIG. 1. Thus, embodiments of the present invention can be &quot;ambidextrous&quot; (i.e., operable with equal ease by either hand) while still providing ergonomic comfort.<br />[0044] It should also be noted that in this embodiment, a user holding grip member 110 in his or her hand can simultaneously cover primary trigger 116 with the index finger, secondary trigger 118 with the second finger, and scroll wheel 120 with the thumb. The ability to simultaneously cover all controls while holding mouse 100 can decrease the user's reaction time and improve game play.<br />COUNTERWEIGHT <br />[0045] Referring again to FIG. 1, barrel member 122 is provided to enhance the pistol-shaped appearance of computer mouse 100. Barrel member 122 affects the weight distribution and stability of computer mouse 100, adding weight generally near the top and forward of grip member 110. To prevent the weight of barrel member 122 from destabilizing mouse 100, a counterweight may be inserted into base member 102. FIG. 8 is a simplified cutaway side view showing base member 102 having a counterweight 802 disposed therein. Counterweight 802, which is advantageously made of a relatively dense material such as steel bar stock, is disposed toward the rearward section 112 of base member 102, under grip member 110. In this position, counterweight 802 advantageously counterbalances the weight of barrel member 122 and shifts the center of mass of mouse 100 downward toward base 102, providing greater stability and allowing mouse 100 to stand upright even when not in use.<br />FURTHER EMBODIMENTS <br />[0046] While the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, one skilled in the art will recognize that numerous modifications are possible. For instance, the particular shapes and design features shown in the drawings may be modified as desired. Moreover, while embodiments described herein are referred to as computer mice and include controls and associated circuitry that provide conventional computer mouse input signals to a computer, it will be appreciated that the invention is not so limited. User input devices with more, fewer, or different controls and signals are also within the scope of the invention, and the arrangement of controls may be varied from that shown and described herein. Dimensions and angles described herein may also be modified or varied as desired.<br />[0047] Electromechanical and electronic signaling elements may also be varied from those shown and described herein. Any type of tracking sensor, including mechanical sensors (e.g., roller sensors of the type used in some conventional computer mice), gyroscopic sensors and so on, may be substituted for the tracking sensors described herein. Any number of control buttons and/or scroll wheels may be arranged in various ways and may activate a variety of mechanical or electromechanical signaling devices to generate input signals for a computer. Input signals may be transmitted to the computer by a variety of transmission techniques, including cables adapted to various protocols (e.g., USB, PS/2) or a wireless (infrared or RF) transmitter element in the mouse configured to communicate with a compatible receiver element in the computer.<br />[0048] In addition, while reference is made herein to use of a computer mouse or input device for playing games, it is to be understood that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to any particular use. An input device in accordance with the present invention may be used for controlling other computer programs such as word processing programs, World Wide Web browsers, and any other program capable of responding to the input signals generated by the device. Further, a pistol-like shape is not required; for instance, in some embodiments, a barrel member may be omitted.<br />[0049] Thus, although the invention has been described with respect to specific embodiments, it will be appreciated that the invention is intended to cover all modifications and equivalents within the scope of the following claims."
US-5261674-A,"A rolling target is made from a heavy duty industrial hose material. The rolling target comprises a target mount, target, and a rim having an angular momentum after 4 mph is obtained that creates a gyroscopic stability to withstand most hits from bullets of a gun. A portable launcher for multiple rolling targets is actuated by a rope pull.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />FIG. 1 is a front plan view of the rolling ground target with a typical bull's eye target mounted.<br />FIG. 2 is a cross sectional view of the rolling ground target taken along line 2--2 of FIG. 1.<br />FIG. 3 is a front plan view of a cardboard target mount cut to fit into the rolling ground target of FIG. 1.<br />FIG. 4 is a top perspective view of a rolling ground target moving down a typical hill.<br />FIG. 5 is a side plan view of the multiple target launcher.<br />FIG. 6 is a top plan view of the multiple target launcher.<br />FIG. 7 is a side plan view of the launching arm mechanism housed inside the walls of FIG. 5 to control the launching of each rolling ground target.<br />(1) Before explaining the disclosed embodiment of the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of the particular arrangement shown, since the invention is capable of other embodiments. Also, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.<br />(2) DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br />(3) FIG. 1 shows a rolling ground target 1 with a typical bull's eye target 2 mounted on a cardboard target mount 3 which is affixed to the inner target rim 4. d(i) is approximately eight inches in diameter. d(o) is approximately 12 inches in diameter. The cardboard target mount 3 is mounted by staples 5, but many mounting means are suitable including push rivets.<br />(4) Referring to FIG. 2, a cross section of the rolling target 1 shows the heavy duty industrial hose construction of rim 6. The rim 6 comprises a thick layer of rubber 7, with steel tire cord 8 and covered by a thick plastic coating 9. Rim 6 should absorb a significant amount of the impact energy of the bullet to prevent ricochet (the process of a bullet fired rebounding toward the shooter.)<br />(5) FIG. 3 shows cardboard target mount 3, that is mounted inside the rim 6 on the inner target rim 4 by staples 5. The cardboard target mount 3 can comprise any penetrable material including plastic, metal, wood and composite materials. The target 2 can be affixed to target mount 3 by any suitable means including glue or staples (not shown). A typical rim 6 is 3 inches wide (d(o)-d(i)) and 3 inches thick, from front to back. d(i) is typically 12, 16 and 24 inches. A 12 inch model weighs 5 pounds (2.268 kg). A 16 inch model weighs 8 pounds (3.629 kg). A 24 inch model weighs 11 pounds (5 kg).<br />(6) In FIG. 4 the rolling target 1 is put into motion (a-e) on a hill where it could acquire speeds ranging from 4-20 mph. At position a, at an approximate speed of 4 mph, enough angular momentum is created to allow the rolling ground target to continue rolling upright over rocks 11, ditches 12, or similar objects like a log 13. Further, numerous hits 40 from a gun 15 as the rolling target moves from a-e are non effective to the target's motion because the target mount 3 (FIG. 1) offers no resistance.<br />(7) The angular moment of the rim 6 has a mass approximately 2.268 kg. This creates a gyroscopic stability that can be related to an impact energy 14 of a projectile 16 from a gun 15. Using principles of a cylindrical shell rolling, an expert knowledgeable in this field can create the relationship with the correct assumptions leaving reasonable error. If the impact energy 14 is equal to or greater than the gyroscopic stability (mvr/2), the rolling target will not fall over. Thus, with an impact energy 14 of approximately 600 ft-lbs (0.813 kgms) the created gyroscopic stability (mvr/2) is large enough to allow direct hits from a bullet 16 to the upper most edge of the rim 6. The rolling target will continue in motion (a-e) on the hill.<br />(8) Wherein:<br />(9) m=2,268 g<br />(10) v=10 mph (4.5 m/s)<br />(11) r=5 inches (0.127 m, r is the distance from the center of the target 1 FIG. 1 to the middle of the rim 6)<br />(12) In this example (mvr/2)=1.296 kgms and the impact energy 14 is 0.813 kgms.<br />(13) FIG. 5 shows a multiple rolling target launcher 50. One person (not shown) that is not shooting gives a quick pull 55 on the rope 51. The rope 51 works through a pulley 52 mounted to a steel plate 53 connected to frame 54. One inch angle iron is suitable for frame 54. Once the rope 51 is pulled 55, a lever 56, connected to the roller 57, launches a rolling target 1a onto the sloped ground 60 through the open end 100. This launching process gives the rolling target 1a enough velocity, as seen in FIG. 4--position a, to be stable for competition. After rolling target 1a is launched in direction 110, a spring 58 attached to lever 56 pulls launcher 50 back into the ready position.<br />(14) At each launch site for competition 61 a launch site pipe 70 (plastic, steel, etc.) is set in concrete base 71 at distances 50 ft, 75 ft, 100 ft, etc.. The rolling target launcher 50 has a pipe 80 (plastic steel, etc.) small enough to fit snug (no movement of launcher if touched) into the launch site pipe 70. The desired height of the launcher 50 from the ground can be determined by height holes 82 in the launcher pipe 80. A simple brace 83 is attached to the floor 84 of the launcher 50 for stability. All walls 85 and floors 84 of the launcher 50 are suitably made of 1/2&quot; plywood bolted (not shown) to frame 54.<br />(15) In FIG. 5, 6, 7 is shown the roller 57 that the rope 51 turns to launch each rolling target 1a, 1b, 1c. The holes 90a, 90b in the floor 84, are for the two arms 91, 92 to pass through as the roller 57 is turned for the launching arm mechanism 95 to work.<br />(16) In FIG. 7 the launching arm mechanism 95 comprises a rope 51 connected to the steel lever 56 connected to the roller 57, pivot 71, arms 91, 92. As the launching arm mechanism 95 launches in direction 110 (FIG. 5) the next rolling target 1b (FIG. 5) is restrained from jamming the launching arm mechanism or falling through the floor hole 90b by a radial piece 93 welded to the plate 92."

If it is the ring 11 that is struck, a two base hit is indicated by the completion of a circuit through a conductor 34, lamps 29 and 30 and conductor 31 as previously indicated. If it is the ring 10 that is struck, then a single base hit is indicated through a conductor 35, only tihe single lamp 30 being illuminated. If ring 10a is struck then no lamp is lighted and this may be counted a strike.<br />(16) It is to be understood that I do not limit 50o myself to tile particular form which the recording mechanism may assume.

US-20200309489-A1,"The invention relates to a decoy (<b>3</b>) for protecting a fast aircraft (<b>1</b>) against an incoming threat (<b>2</b>), wherein said decoy is non-driven. The decoy (<b>3</b>) has a squib (<b>6</b>) on one end and a molded body (<b>11</b>) on the opening side. If the decoy (<b>3</b>) has an active material container (<b>8</b>), the squib (<b>6</b>) can be attached to the end side thereof and the molded body (<b>11</b>) attached to the opening side thereof. The squib (<b>6</b>) contains a propellant, which is converted into a drive energy. The molded body (<b>11</b>) is heavier than the decoy (<b>3</b>) without the molded body (<b>11</b>) and has the task of preventing the separating of the molded body (<b>3</b>) to the rear. In addition, the molded body (<b>11</b>) should be at least 1.0-1.5 times heavier than the decoy itself. Advantageously, however, the molded body (<b>11</b>) is twice as heavy.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />[0020] The invention will be explained in more detail based on an exemplary embodiment with a drawing. In the figures:<br />[0021] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref> shows a schematic representation of a typical deployment scenario of an aircraft with a dummy target,<br />[0022] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a slightly transparent representation of the dummy target before firing with the essential components,<br />[0023] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> shows a representation of the dummy target from <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> after firing.<br />DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br />[0024] A fast-flying aircraft (fast flyer) <b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>. This representation in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref> shows the view from a threat <b>2</b>, in this case the view from a search head.<br />[0025] To ward off this threat, after detection a decoy <b>3</b> is deployed against the threat to simulate a dummy target <b>3</b>′. For this purpose, the fast-flying aircraft <b>1</b> has at least one launcher <b>4</b>, which is designed to be able to eject the decoy <b>3</b> forwards in the direction of flight of the fast flyer <b>1</b>. At least one warning sensor <b>5</b> is envisaged as a detection sensor, which detects the incoming threat <b>2</b> and activates the launcher <b>4</b> or the protection system, which counters the threat <b>2</b> with the decoy <b>3</b>. Due to the property of this decoy <b>3</b> and the mode of action of the threat <b>2</b>, the threat <b>2</b> perceives this decoy <b>3</b> as a more attractive target and switches to this dummy target <b>3</b>′. The decoy <b>3</b> is deployed forwards relative to the aircraft at an angle, preferably in a solid angle to the fast-flying aircraft <b>1</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>).<br />[0026] The structure of the decoy <b>3</b> is shown by <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>.<br />[0027] The decoy <b>3</b> comprises an igniter <b>6</b>, which is attached at the end to an active material container <b>8</b> of the decoy <b>3</b>. For safety reasons, a tube sensor <b>7</b> is provided between a sabot <b>10</b> and the igniter <b>6</b>. The active material container <b>8</b> is used in turn to accommodate an active material <b>9</b>.<br />[0028] At the front or on the muzzle side, a molded body <b>11</b> is integrated on the active material container <b>8</b>. The molded body <b>11</b> attached to the active material container <b>8</b> on the muzzle side is of a solid construction. The weight of the molded body <b>11</b> is greater than the weight of the decoy <b>3</b> without the molded body <b>11</b>. As a rule, the molded body <b>11</b> for fast-flying aircraft should be at least 1.0-1.5 times what the decoy <b>3</b> would weigh without molded body <b>11</b>. In practice, it has been shown to be sufficient if the molded body <b>11</b> is twice as heavy as the decoy <b>3</b> itself without the molded body <b>11</b>. The molded body <b>11</b> can preferably consist of tungsten.<br />[0029] The molded body <b>11</b> and the igniter <b>6</b> or the propellant contained therein are coordinated with each other in such a way that the expected recoil is precisely adjusted.<br />[0030] <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> shows the decoy <b>3</b> shortly after ejection from a launch tube of the launcher <b>4</b> that is not shown in detail. With the ignition of an ignition charge (propellant) in the igniter <b>6</b>, the decoy <b>3</b> receives a power input, i.e. a driving force that not only drives it out of the launch tube of the launcher <b>4</b>, but counteracts a recoil pulse that usually occurs during launch and thus does not allow it to arise. The decoy <b>3</b> acted upon by this surplus impulse moves in front of the fast-flying aircraft <b>1</b> as a result of the impulse, wherein in this phase the decoy <b>3</b> becomes a dummy target <b>3</b>′. For this purpose, the tube sensor <b>7</b> releases the ignition channel, which is not shown in detail, wherein the active material <b>9</b> is ignited and the dummy target <b>3</b>′ forms.<br />[0031] The expansion of the dummy target <b>3</b>′ is perceived by the threat <b>2</b> as a target, as it is set up in the direction of the fast-flying aircraft <b>1</b>. The active material <b>9</b>, in turn, lights up for so long that the threat <b>2</b> can no longer lock on to the fast-flying aircraft <b>1</b> when it flies past the dummy target <b>3</b>′."

It is desirable that another screw 1I be provided to extend 4 through the side of the magazine B3 and the cud-niece I), to prevent the possibility of the said end piece twisting in, or slipping from, the end of the magazine, thereby keeping the alignment of the magazine and the barrel perfectly true. The rear end of the magazine is connected to the stock of the firearmi in the ordinary and well-known manner.<br />(10) In operation, the arms E E' are slipped over the sides of the barrel and the endpiece attached to the outer end of the cartridge maga- zinc.

US-20080148930-A1,"A protective device and protective measure for a radar system is provided that includes an active countermeasure by using passive emitter and/or decoys. Decoys are thereby utilized that function according to the reflection principle. These decoys are thereby radiated by the vehicle's radar. The radiation reflected by the decoys in the direction of the ARM has the same characteristic as the direct radiation from the radar itself. Thus, the ARM is unable to discriminate between decoys and the actual radar.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />[0019] The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, and thus, are not limitive of the present invention, and wherein:<br />[0020] FIG. 1 illustrates an ARM attack;<br />[0021] FIG. 2 illustrates a deployment of passive decoys; and<br />[0022] FIGS. 3 and 4 illustrates the ARM locking onto a decoy cloud and flying past the radar.<br />DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br />[0023] In FIG. 1, an exemplary scenario is illustrated, whereby from a launcher 1, for example, an aircraft, an ARM 2 is aimed at a vehicle 3 with radar 4, whereby the ARM 2 locks onto the radar signal of radar 4. Radar 4 can be the SKYRANGER Search Radar and Control Centre owned by Oerlikon Contraves AG, for example. In this circumstance, the Search Radar detects the incoming ARM and activates the countermeasure, that is, the protective measure.<br />[0024] The rotating radar antenna 4.1 is stopped, and oriented in a direction that is opposite to the flight direction of the ARM 2. At roughly the same time, the decoys 5 are thrust upwards, that is, are launched (FIG. 2), which then, radiated by the vehicle's 3 own radar 4, represent an emission source for the ARM 2, to which it locks on, as illustrated in FIG. 3, to fly past the radar 4, and thus past the vehicle 3, at substantially that height (FIG. 4).<br />[0025] The decoys 5 can be provided in a container (not further illustrated) in vehicle 3. A direct proximity to radar 4 is thereby preferred. This container can be brought to a defined height. There, it is opened such that it releases the decoys automatically so that they can accomplish their task.<br />[0026] These band-shaped bodies 5 are manufactured of a conductive material and, for example, have approximately half the wavelength of the emitted electromagnetic field.<br />[0027] Thus, the container releases the decoys for the protective measure. The bodies 5 form a dipole cloud and/or wall 6 of, for example, one-half wavelength behind the radar 4 and acts as a large scattering object 7 (FIG. 3). The radar 4 now radiates this wall 6 (radiation 8), and the seeker of the ARM 2 receives this scattered light (radiation 8). To the ARM 2, this reflected radiation (8') is far more interesting than the radar 4 itself, which, moreover, does not emit in the direction of the attack (FIG. 4).<br />[0028] Vehicle 3 includes all land, air, and water craft (ships) in a traditional sense.<br />[0029] It is understood that methods other than the one known from SKYRANGER for determining the distance of an object flying through the atmosphere can be used here. Such a method, for example, deploying a passive sensor, is described in DE 195 46 873 C1. After detecting the incoming object, the countermeasure is then activated in the described manner. An additional radar, which radiates the decoys 5, could also be provided. However, in this circumstance, the actual radar 4 should be positioned in relation to the attacking ARM 2 such that it is not recognized as a source by the ARM 2.<br />[0030] The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are to be included within the scope of the following claims."

While these various embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the disclosure, it should be understood that other embodiments may be realized and that logical, chemical, electrical, and mechanical changes may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure. Thus, the detailed description herein is presented for purposes of illustration only and not of limitation.<br />(17) For example, the steps recited in any of the method or process descriptions may be executed in any order and are not necessarily limited to the order presented. Furthermore, any reference to singular includes plural embodiments, and any reference to more than one component or step may include a singular embodiment or step. Also, any reference to attached, fixed, connected, or the like may include permanent, removable, temporary, partial, full, and/or any other possible attachment option. Additionally, any reference to without contact (or similar phrases) may also include reduced contact or minimal contact.<br />(18) For example, in the context of the present disclosure, methods, systems, and articles may find particular use in connection with compound bows. However, various aspects of the disclosed embodiments may be adapted for performance in a variety of other mechanical systems. As such, numerous applications of the present disclosure may be realized.<br />(19) Compound bows may include one or more cam assemblies configured to provide a mechanical advantage for a user pulling the drawstring of the compound bow. Typically, the output force of the compound bow is directly dependent on the amount of force required to bring the drawstring to a fully drawn position. In general, as the drawstring is pulled, cams mounted on opposing limbs of the compound bow rotate, thereby deflecting the limbs and storing energy in the bow. The shape and orientation of the cams is configured to provide a mechanical advantage to a user pulling the drawstring. The force required by a user to pull the drawstring may peak shortly after the initial pull and plateau until the drawstring reaches the fully drawn position. However, such a force may be too great for some users.<br />(20) Recently, certain compound bows have been developed which may allow a portion of the output energy to be prestored as potential energy in the compound bow before the remaining energy is generated by pulling the drawstring. Compound bows such as these may allow a user to pull the drawstring to store a fraction of the total energy to be released from the system, thereby allowing a user lacking the requisite strength to operate a bow with greater output energy, and therefore, greater arrow velocity. However, such compound bows may lack the ability to allow a user to release the energy resulting from the user pulling the drawstring, without also releasing the potential energy prestored in the compound bow. Such functionality may be beneficial in the event the user is not ready to release the arrow for various reasons.<br />(21) Accordingly, with reference to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>, a side view of a power assisted bow <b>100</b> with an energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> is illustrated in a rest position, in accordance with various embodiments.

First auxiliary limb <b>118</b> may be coupled to a terminal end of first member <b>106</b>, while second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> may be coupled to a second terminal end of second member <b>108</b>. As such, in various embodiments, first main limb <b>114</b> and first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> may be positioned on an opposite end of central body <b>102</b> than second main limb <b>116</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b>.<br />(23) First auxiliary limb <b>118</b> may be coupled to power assisted bow <b>100</b> such that first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> is positioned inward (inward referring generally to a direction toward energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b>) of first main limb <b>114</b>. Similarly, second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> may be coupled to power assisted bow <b>100</b> such that second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> is positioned inward of second main limb <b>116</b>.

Clamp <b>306</b> may comprise a first jaw <b>316</b> and a second jaw <b>318</b> configured to rotate to open and close.<br />(41) With reference to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref>, first jaw <b>316</b> and second jaw <b>318</b> may define a drawstring aperture <b>320</b> when first jaw <b>316</b> and second jaw <b>318</b> are in a closed position. Drawstring aperture <b>320</b> may comprise a diameter substantially equal to that of drawstring <b>142</b> and may be configured to be coupled to drawstring <b>142</b> such that dual function lever <b>300</b> may assist a user in pulling drawstring <b>142</b>. Once it is desired to release energy stored in power assisted bow <b>100</b> by releasing drawstring <b>142</b>, clamp release lever <b>308</b> may be actuated, which may separate first jaw <b>316</b> and second jaw <b>318</b> and allow the drawstring <b>142</b> to be released from dual function lever <b>300</b>.<br />(42) With reference now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>, dual function lever <b>300</b> is illustrated adjacent to power assisted bow <b>100</b>, in accordance with various embodiments. In various embodiments, shaft aperture <b>310</b> may be configured to mate with charge shaft <b>232</b>, thereby allowing dual function lever <b>300</b> to charge energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b>. Specifically, shaft aperture <b>310</b> of dual function lever <b>300</b> may comprise a complementary geometry to charge shaft <b>232</b>. For example, in various embodiments, shaft aperture <b>310</b> and charge shaft <b>232</b> may each comprise a hexagonal geometry. Such geometry may increase a contact surface area between shaft aperture <b>310</b> and charge shaft <b>232</b>. Dual function lever <b>300</b> may be coupled to charge shaft <b>232</b> via shaft aperture <b>310</b>. Specifically, charge shaft <b>232</b> may be inserted through shaft aperture <b>310</b>. Energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> may be charged in response to rotation of dual function lever <b>300</b>. Lever arm <b>304</b> may function as a moment arm allowing the user to apply a greater amount of rotational force to charge shaft <b>232</b> through dual function lever <b>300</b>.<br />(43) Returning now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>, dual function lever <b>300</b> is illustrated coupled to energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> while power assisted bow <b>100</b> is in a rest position, in accordance with various embodiments. In this position, power assisted bow <b>100</b> may be in the position illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref> with first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> in a rested, non-deflected position. As previously discussed, dual function lever <b>300</b> may be coupled to energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> by placing charge shaft <b>232</b> through shaft aperture in dual function lever <b>300</b>.<br />(44) Dual function lever <b>300</b> may allow a user to rotate charge cam <b>262</b> and/or charge cam lock washer <b>226</b> to charge power assisted bow <b>100</b>. Charge cam lock washer <b>226</b> may be configured to corotate with charge cam <b>262</b>. For example, referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref> and <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref>, in a rest position, charge cam <b>262</b> may be positioned substantially vertically, however, is not limited in this regard. In response to a user applying a force to dual function lever <b>300</b>, charge cam <b>262</b> may rotate in a clockwise direction as illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref>. Charge cam <b>262</b> and charge shaft <b>232</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>) may continue to rotate until first finger <b>264</b> may contact first charge cable <b>166</b> and second finger <b>266</b> may contact second charge cable <b>168</b>. As charge cam <b>262</b> rotates, first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b> may be pulled inwardly (in a direction toward charge cam <b>262</b>). In such a way, first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b> under tension may cause first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> to deflect inward. Such inward deflection of first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> may “charge” power assisted bow <b>100</b> such that a portion of the total output energy of power assisted bow may be stored as potential energy in first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b>.<br />(45) In various embodiments, the structure of charge cam <b>262</b>, first finger <b>264</b>, second finger <b>266</b>, first charge cable, and second charge cable <b>168</b> may be configured that energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> may be locked upon first finger <b>264</b> contacting first charge cable <b>166</b> and second finger <b>266</b> contacting second charge cable <b>168</b>. In other words, upon being contacted by first finger <b>264</b> and second finger <b>266</b> respectively, first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b> may deflect such that the energy stored in first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> remains stored in the limbs without the risk of the system releasing this stored energy prematurely. Therefore, in the charged position illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref>, power assisted bow <b>100</b> may also be considered “locked” and may be stowed, carried, aimed, or otherwise maneuvered with all or a portion of the total potential energy stored in the system.<br />(46) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref>, power assisted bow <b>100</b> is illustrated from a side view in the charged locked position, in accordance with various embodiments. As previously stated, dual function lever <b>300</b> may be used to rotate charge cam <b>262</b>, thereby causing first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b> to become tensioned. This may cause first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> to deflect inwardly (as indicated by the arrows), thereby separating from first main limb <b>114</b> and second main limb <b>116</b>, respectively. As further stated previously, the charged energy may be “locked” in power assisted bow <b>100</b>. In this position, dual function lever <b>300</b> may be removed and coupled to drawstring <b>142</b>.<br />(47) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 9</figref>, power assisted bow <b>100</b> is illustrated in a charged fully drawn position, in accordance with various embodiments. In various embodiments, drawstring <b>142</b> may be pulled using dual function lever <b>300</b>. Power assisted bow <b>100</b> is not limited in this regard and drawstring <b>142</b> may be pulled using any suitable means, for example, a user's hand, finger or a device capable of pulling drawstring <b>142</b>. In response to drawstring <b>142</b> being pulled, first cam <b>134</b> and second cam <b>136</b> may rotate in opposite directions due to drawstring being coupled to first cam <b>134</b> and second cam <b>136</b>. In response, first buss cable <b>144</b> may wrap around inner profile <b>160</b> of second cam <b>136</b> and second buss cable <b>146</b> may wrap around inner profile <b>162</b> of first cam <b>134</b>. As a result, first buss cable <b>144</b> being coupled to second main limb <b>116</b> and second buss cable <b>146</b> being coupled to first main limb <b>114</b> may cause first main limb <b>114</b> and second main limb <b>116</b> to deflect inwardly (as indicated by the arrows). First main limb <b>114</b> may contact first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> at first contact location <b>126</b> and second main limb <b>116</b> may contact second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> at second contact location <b>132</b>. By contacting first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b>, respectively, first main limb <b>114</b> and second main limb <b>116</b> may relieve tension in first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b>. This may allow charge cam <b>262</b> to counterrotate (in the counterclockwise direction), thereby unlocking all of the stored energy in power assisted bow <b>100</b>. At this stage, all of the energy stored in power assisted bow <b>100</b> may be released in response to drawstring <b>142</b> being released.<br />(48) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 10</figref>, energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> is illustrated from a first side while power assisted bow is in a charged fully drawn position, in accordance with various embodiments. As previously stated, in the charged fully drawn position, all energy stored in power assisted bow <b>100</b> may be released in response to a user releasing the drawstring. In this position, lock plate <b>228</b> may be positioned such that first tooth <b>240</b> is in contact with an upper portion of tooth <b>234</b> of charge cam lock washer <b>226</b>. Lock plate <b>228</b> may be biased in the counterclockwise direction via biasing member <b>238</b>. Biasing member <b>238</b> may be configured to urge rotation of the lock plate <b>228</b> to allow rotation of the charge cam <b>262</b> to release stored energy in power assisted bow <b>100</b>. In response to the drawstring <b>142</b> being released, first main limb <b>114</b> and second main limb <b>116</b> may return to a non-deflected original position due to the elastic nature of first main limb <b>114</b> and second main limb <b>116</b>. Following this, first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> may return to an original position due to the elastic nature of first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b>. As first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> expand outwardly, first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> may apply a tensile force to first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b>, thereby causing charge shaft <b>232</b> to counterrotate in the clockwise direction. In turn, rotating element <b>226</b> and charge cam <b>262</b> may also counterrotate, releasing energy stored in power assisted bow <b>100</b>.<br />(49) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> from a second side while power assisted bow <b>100</b> is in charged fully drawn position. In the charged fully drawn position, first finger <b>264</b> and second finger <b>266</b> may be separated from first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b>, such that first finger <b>264</b> and second finger <b>266</b> do not contact first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b>, respectively. As previously discussed, stored energy in first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> may be “locked” when first finger <b>264</b> and second finger <b>266</b> are in contact with first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b>. As such, in the position illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 11</figref>, all the energy stored in power assisted bow may be released upon releasing of the drawstring.<br />(50) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 13</figref>, energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> is illustrated in a charged relocked position, in accordance with various embodiments. In the event a user does not wish to release the drawstring when power assisted bow <b>100</b> is in a charged fully drawn position, energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> may allow the prestored energy in the first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and the second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> to remain stored in power assisted bow <b>100</b> as the user lets down the drawstring and prepares for another shot. More specifically, in response to a desire to let down the drawstring without releasing the energy stored in first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b>, relock lever <b>260</b> may be actuated. Relock lever <b>260</b> may be positioned adjacent to grip <b>104</b> such that relock lever <b>260</b> may be actuated without the need to adjust a position of a user's hand, in various embodiments.<br />(51) As relock lever <b>260</b> is actuated (rotated in the direction indicated by the arrow), relock cord <b>252</b> coupled to one end of relock lever <b>260</b> may be tensioned, thereby exerting a force on boss <b>244</b>. Such a force may be greater than the biasing force applied by biasing member <b>238</b> such that lock plate <b>228</b> rotates in a clockwise direction (as indicated by the arrows). In response, second tooth <b>242</b> of lock plate <b>228</b> may contact tooth <b>234</b> of charge cam lock washer <b>226</b>, thereby counterrotating charge cam lock washer <b>226</b>, charge shaft <b>232</b>, and charge cam <b>262</b> (as indicated by the arrow), thereby relocking energy in energy storage and relock mechanism <b>200</b> and power assisted bow <b>100</b>. <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates charge cam <b>262</b> in a charged relocked position. Similar to the charged locked position, first finger <b>264</b> and second finger <b>266</b> of charge cam <b>262</b> may contact first charge cable <b>166</b> and second charge cable <b>168</b>, respectively, such that energy remains stored in first auxiliary limb <b>118</b> and second auxiliary limb <b>120</b> (not shown). Power assisted bow <b>100</b> may now be configured such that a user may redraw drawstring <b>142</b> and prepare for another shot, with the total energy in the bow at his or her disposal once again.<br />(52) A block diagram illustrating a method <b>400</b> of storing and relocking potential energy in a power assisted bow is illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 14</figref>, in accordance with various embodiments. The method may comprise storing a first amount of potential energy in the power assisted bow via an energy storage and relock mechanism (step <b>402</b>). The method may further comprise locking the first amount of potential energy in the power assisted bow via the energy storage and relock mechanism (step <b>404</b>). The method may further comprise generating a second amount of potential energy in the power assisted bow in response to a drawstring of the power assisted bow being pulled (step <b>406</b>). The method may further comprise relocking the first amount of potential energy in the power assisted bow via the energy storage and relock mechanism (step <b>408</b>). The method may further comprise relieving the second amount of potential energy in the power assisted bow in response to the drawstring being let down (step <b>410</b>).<br />(53) Benefits, other advantages, and solutions to problems have been described herein with regard to specific embodiments.

The fletching groove of the present invention is integral to the crossbow and extends the approximate length of the crossbow's stock. As a result, the present fletching groove is easy to use and is conveniently integral to the crossbow design. As will be described, the modified fletching groove as disclosed consists of components configured and correlated with respect to each other so as to attain the desired objective.<br />(9) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates a crossbow generally designated <b>100</b>. Crossbow <b>100</b> is substantially of any conventional construction, and includes a rifle-style stock <b>12</b> having a rearward end <b>12</b><i>a </i>from which a butt portion <b>18</b> extends, and a forward end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. Stock <b>12</b> further includes slide or fletching groove <b>22</b> to mount a bolt and carries a bow <b>16</b> with bowstring <b>17</b> proximate the forward end <b>12</b><i>b</i>. As known, bowstring <b>17</b> is moveable between a released position and a drawn position whereby bowstring <b>17</b> is pulled toward rearward end <b>12</b><i>a</i>. A trigger mechanism is carried by stock <b>12</b> and includes a trigger <b>19</b> mounted proximate rearward end <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a latch <b>21</b>. Latch <b>21</b> engages and retains bowstring <b>17</b> in the drawn position and releases bowstring <b>17</b> into the released position when disengaged from bowstring <b>17</b>. Trigger <b>19</b> and latch <b>21</b> are not described in detail since substantially any trigger mechanism can be employed, and are well known in the art.<br />(10) In application, an arrow having three fletchings rest on the fletching groove <b>22</b> that extends the approximate length of the stock <b>12</b>. As is known, one of the fletchings of the arrow inserts into the fletching groove <b>22</b> of the stock <b>12</b>.<br />(11) From the outset, it should be understood that the present invention relates solely to a modified fletching groove that assists with efficiently setting a crossbow into an armed or fully drawn position. The present invention does not alter the known application of the prior art latch or trigger mechanism as described, nor the releasing or shooting the conventional crossbow. In this regard, the bolt or arrow is received in the fletching groove as known, the bowstring is grasped by hand or hands, and drawn towards the cocked position. However, as will be described the present device diminishes or even eliminates the difficulty and extreme force necessary to cock a crossbow in one continuous effort. Again, the above described cycle of operation in a crossbow is widely known and not altered by the present invention.<br />(12) Referring to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 2-7</figref>, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is shown, a modified fletching groove for a crossbow designated as numeral <b>22</b>. The modified fletching groove <b>22</b> that as earlier described, extends the approximate length of the stock <b>12</b>. And, as is known, one of the fletchings of the arrow inserts into the fletching groove <b>22</b> of the stock <b>12</b>.<br />(13) The fletching groove <b>22</b> includes at least one setting generally designated as numeral <b>30</b>, the setting <b>30</b> selectively disposed between the rearward end <b>12</b><i>a </i>and forward end <b>12</b><i>b </i>of the stock <b>12</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the modified fletching groove <b>22</b> includes at least one setting <b>30</b> disposed along the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b> and preferably, one of the settings of the at least one setting <b>30</b> is disposed at a location L (see <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>) approximately three quarter (¾) the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b>, proximate the rearward end <b>12</b><i>a. </i><br />(14) As illustrated, the setting <b>30</b> defines a path <b>32</b> that includes at least a first direction (illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> with arrow <b>34</b>) and a second direction (arrow <b>35</b>) and a defined catch <b>36</b>. The first direction <b>34</b> preferably extends downwardly and slants towards the forward end of the stock <b>12</b>. The second direction <b>35</b> preferably extends from the lower most end <b>38</b> of the first direction, and upwardly extends at a slanted angle towards the forward end. In this embodiment of the setting <b>30</b>, the incline surface <b>35</b>A of the second direction <b>35</b> is at substantially forty-five degrees relative to the top surface <b>31</b> of the fletching groove <b>22</b>. The second direction <b>35</b> further defines an upper most end <b>39</b> that includes the catch <b>36</b> adjacent the upper most end.<br />(15) The at least one setting <b>30</b> as defined for receiving the bowstring <b>17</b> at selected intervals along the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b>.<br />(16) An advantage is provided by the arrangement of the at least one setting <b>30</b> as defined. In the preferred embodiment, as the bowstring is urged a certain distance towards the latch <b>21</b> and being fully drawn, the bowstring may be received within one of the settings <b>30</b> disposed along the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b>, before reaching the latch <b>21</b>. This reduces the effort needed to cock a crossbow in one continuous effort. Thus, a crossbow can be cocked in intervals, depending upon the number of settings <b>30</b> disposed along the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b>, rather than the known difficulties of cocking a crossbow in one continuous effort.<br />(17) The modified fletching groove <b>22</b> includes one setting <b>30</b> preferably disposed at location L approximately three quarter (¾) the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b>. A more complex design having multiple settings <b>30</b> along the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b> can be employed to increase the advantage. Those skilled in the art will understand that the advantage created by the at least one setting <b>30</b> can be increased or eliminated as desired, according to the positioning of the at least one setting <b>30</b> along the length of the fletching groove <b>22</b>.<br />(18) Although the above description contains many specificities, these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the presently preferred embodiments of this invention. As such, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the claims.<br />(19) It would be obvious to those skilled in the art that modifications may be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the scope of the present invention. Thus the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims in the formal application and their legal equivalents, rather than by the examples given."

The attachment assembly 1 includes a fastener 4 and a locking member 5. The fastener 4 has a first end 6 and a second end 7. The fastener 4 is receivable in a hole 8 in the shotgun 3 such that the first and second ends 6 and 7 are accessible on opposite sides of the shotgun, as shown in FIG. 5. A first opening 9 extends in the fastener 4 perpendicular to the fastener longitudinal axis and proximal the first end 6 to receive the swivel 27 of the sling 2. The locking member 5 is receivable by the second end 7 to prevent removal of the fastener 4 from the shotgun hole 8 when connected to the shotgun 3.<br />[0043] The fastener 4 has a substantially cylindrical body 10 with an enlarged head member 11 disposed at an end thereof, as shown in FIGS. 1-3. The enlarged head member 11 has a diameter larger than the diameter of the body 10. A first opening 9 is disposed in the enlarged head member 11. Preferably, the first opening 9 extends entirely through the enlarged head member 11. A second opening 12 extends axially inwardly in the body 10 from the second end 7 of the fastener 4, as shown in FIG. 3. The second opening 12 is preferably threaded and is preferably formed by drilling and tapping. First and second notches 13 and 14 extend circumferentially around the body 10 of the fastener 4. The first and second notches 13 and 14 are preferably disposed in the body 10 between the first and second ends 6 and 7. The fastener 4 is preferably unitarily formed as a single member and made of steel, such as 12L14 steel. Alternatively, the enlarged head member 11 can be separately formed and connected to the body 10 in any suitable manner, such as by a threaded connection. The fastener body 10 and enlarged head member 11 are preferably substantially solid members.<br />[0044] The locking member 5 includes a shaft 15 having a head member 16 disposed at an end thereof, as shown in FIG. 3. The shaft 15 is preferably threaded. A second opening 17 is disposed in the head member 16 to receive a tool 41, such as an alien key, to facilitate engaging the locking member 5 with the fastener 4. The locking member 5 is preferably unitarily formed as a single member and made of steel, such as 12L14 steel.<br />[0045] First and second washers 18 and 19 are disposed on the body 10 of the fastener 4 to prevent damage to the shotgun 3 from the enlarged head member 11 of the fastener 4 and the head member 16 of the locking member 5. The first and second washers 18 and 19 are preferably substantially circular having openings 20 and 21 therein to receive the fastener body 10. Preferably, the first and second washers 18 and 19 have an outer diameter corresponding to the outer diameter of the enlarged head member 11 and the head member 16, respectively. The first and second washers 18 and 19 are preferably made of nylon, or other suitable scratch resistant material.<br />[0046] To connect the attachment assembly 1 to a firearm, such as Remington or Winchester style shotguns, the first washer 18 is disposed on the body 10 of the fastener 4, as shown in FIG. 4. The first washer 18 is disposed adjacent a substantially planar surface 22 of the enlarged head member 11. The second end 7 of the fastener 4 is positioned on the shotgun's rear trigger group pin (not shown), which is located rearward of the front trigger group pin 23. A tool (not shown) is used to tap the enlarged head member 11 of the fastener 4, thereby driving the rear trigger group pin out of the shotgun 3. The rear trigger group pin can then be manually removed to provide a pin hole 8 in which the fastener 4 can be inserted. By using the rear trigger group pin, the muzzle of the shotgun 3 is raised higher from the ground, thereby facilitating carrying the shotgun and avoiding unwanted debris from entering the barrel. Alternatively, the forward trigger group pin 23 can be removed to provide a pin hole for insertion of the fastener 4. A substantially similar procedure can be used to remove a pin of a shotgun having only a single pin to secure the trigger group in place.<br />[0047] The second end 7 of the fastener 4 is inserted in the pin hole 8 until the first washer 18 engages a first sidewall 24 of the shotgun, as shown in FIG. 7. A beveled surface 25 at the second end 7 of the fastener 4 facilitates inserting the fastener in the pin hole 8. The outer diameters of the enlarged head portion 11 and the first washer 18 are larger than the diameter of the pin hole 8, thereby limiting an insertion depth of the fastener 4 and the first washer 18 in the pin hole 8. Accordingly, movement of the fastener 4 in a first direction is limited. The first notch 13 engages a spring member 35 of the trigger group assembly, as shown in FIG. 5, thereby further facilitating retention of the fastener 4 of the attachment assembly 1 in the shotgun 3. Alternatively, when inserting the fastener 4 from the left side as shown in FIG. 5, the second notch 14 of the fastener 4 engages the spring member 35. Accordingly, the fastener 4 is installable from either side of the firearm to accommodate left and right-handed shooters. The first washer 18 substantially prevents the enlarged head member 11 of the fastener 4 from scratching, marring or otherwise damaging the finish of the first side wall 24 of the shotgun 3.<br />[0048] The second end 7 of the fastener 4 passes entirely through the shotgun and is accessible on the second sidewall 25. The second washer 19 is disposed on the body 10 of the fastener 4 in a position abutting the second sidewall 25 of the shotgun 3.<br />[0049] An adhesive is disposed on the internal threads of the second opening 12 prior to inserting the locking member 5 therein. The locking member 5 is then inserted in the second opening 12 in the fastener 4, as shown in FIG. 7. The second washer 19 substantially prevents the locking member 5 from scratching, marring or otherwise damaging the finish of the second side wall 25 of the shotgun. The locking member 5 is threaded into the second opening 12 until snug by rotatably engaging the tool 41 with the locking member opening 17. The adhesive is allowed to set, thereby further facilitating securing the attachment assembly 1 to the shotgun 3 and preventing loosening of the threaded connection between the fastener 4 and the locking member 5.<br />[0050] The outer diameters of the enlarged head 16 of the locking member 5 and the second washer 19 are larger than the diameter of the pin hole 8, thereby preventing the fastener 4, the locking member 5 and the second washer 19 from being withdrawn from the pin hole 8 in a second direction. The second direction is substantially opposite to the first direction.<br />[0051] A swivel 27 of the sling 2 is passed through the opening 9 in the enlarged head member 11 of the fastener 4 of the attachment assembly 1, as shown in FIG. 8. A clevis pin or any other suitable member can be connected to the swivel 27 to prevent accidental removal of the swivel 27 from the opening 9 in the enlarged head member 11. The fastener 4 is a substantially linear member, thereby increasing its strength such that the attachment assembly 1 substantially resists breaking during use. The enlarged head member 11 and the locking member 5 of the attachment assembly 1 being connected to the firearm 3 at opposite sides thereof substantially prevents wobble or other movement between the attachment assembly and the firearm. By substantially preventing such movement, warping of the pin hole 8, which can lead to a loose fitting between the attachment assembly and the firearm, is substantially eliminated.<br />[0052] Accordingly, the attachment assembly 1 can be quickly and easily connected to the shotgun 3 without requiring gunsmithing. As shown in FIG. 8, a single-point connection is used to connect the sling 2 to the shotgun 3, as is commonly used in the military. As shown in FIG. 9, a second swivel 28 is connected to an existing, conventional fastener assembly 29 connected to the shotgun 3, thereby forming a two-point connection for the sling 2.<br />Second Exemplary Embodiment<br />[0053] A second exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 10 and 11 for securing a sling to a shotgun. The attachment assembly 101 of the second exemplary embodiment is substantially similar to the attachment assembly 1 of the first exemplary embodiment with the exception of the differences noted below. Similar reference numerals are used to indicate similar features, except in the 100 series, e.g., &quot;1xx.&quot;<br />[0054] As shown in FIG. 10, the attachment assembly 101 includes a fastener 104 and a locking member 105. A portion 112 of a cylindrical body 110 of the fastener 104 extending rearwardly from a second end 107 of the fastener 104 is externally threaded. First and second notches 113 and 114 extend circumferentially around the body 110 of the fastener 104. The first and second notches 113 and 114 are preferably disposed in the body 110 between first and second ends 106 and 107.<br />[0055] The locking member 105 is a substantially cap-shaped member, as shown in FIG. 10. An opening 130 extends inwardly from a first end 131 to a second end 132 of the locking member 105. The locking member opening 130 is preferably threaded. A gripping surface 133 extends circumferentially around an outer surface 134 of the locking member 105. The locking member 5 is preferably unitarily formed as a single member and made of steel, such as 12L14 steel.<br />[0056] The attachment assembly 101 of the second exemplary embodiment is assembled in a substantially similar manner as the attachment assembly 1 of the first exemplary embodiment. The locking member 105 is threaded onto the threaded portion 112 of the fastener 104, as shown in FIG. 11. A swivel (27 of FIGS. 8 and 9) can be connected to the first opening 109 of the fastener 104 as described above. The attachment assembly 101 of the second exemplary embodiment facilitates connecting a sling to a firearm, such as a Mossberg and Benelli style shotguns.<br />Third Exemplary Embodiment<br />[0057] A third exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 12 and 13 for securing a sling to a shotgun. The attachment assembly 201 of the third exemplary embodiment is substantially similar to the attachment assembly 1 of the first exemplary embodiment with the exception of the differences noted below. Similar reference numerals are used to indicate similar features, except in the 200 series, e.g., &quot;2xx.&quot;<br />[0058] As shown in FIG. 12, the attachment assembly 201 includes a fastener 204 and a locking member 205. The fastener 204 has a first end 206 and a second end 207. A second opening 212 extends axially inwardly in a body 210 of the fastener 204 from the second end 7 thereof. The second opening 212 is preferably threaded and is preferably formed by drilling and tapping.<br />[0059] An enlarged head member 211 is disposed at the first end 206 of the fastener 204, as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. The enlarged head member 211 has a diameter larger than the diameter of the body 210. A first opening 209 is disposed in the enlarged head member 211. Preferably, the first opening 209 extends partially into the enlarged head member 211, as shown in FIG. 12, and does not pass entirely through the enlarged head member. Preferably, the first opening 209 extends axially inwardly from the first end 206 of the fastener 204. The first opening 209 has a first substantially cylindrical portion 251, as shown in FIG. 12. A second portion 252 of the first opening 209 tapers inwardly. A groove 253 is formed in a surface of the first portion 251 of the opening 209 to facilitate receiving a pushbutton or quick connect swivel.<br />[0060] First and second notches 213 and 214 extend circumferentially around the body 210 of the fastener 204. The first and second notches 213 and 214 are preferably disposed in the body 10 between the first and second ends 206 and 207. The fastener 204 is preferably unitarily formed as a single member and made of steel, such as 12L14 steel. Alternatively, the enlarged head member 211 can be separately formed and connected to the body 210 in any suitable manner, such as by a threaded connection. The fastener body 210 and enlarged head member 211 are preferably substantially solid members<br />[0061] The locking member 205 is substantially similar to the locking member 5 of the first exemplary embodiment. The locking member 205 is connected to the fastener 204 in a substantially similar manner as connecting the locking member 5 to the fastener 4 of the first exemplary embodiment. The outer diameter of a first washer 218 is preferably larger than an outer diameter of the second washer 219, as shown in FIG. 11.<br />[0062] The attachment assembly 201 of the third exemplary embodiment is assembled in a substantially similar manner as the attachment assembly 1 of the first exemplary embodiment. The first opening 209 in the enlarged head member 211 is adapted to receive a quick-connect swivel, as shown in FIG. 21 and described more fully below.<br />Fourth Exemplary Embodiment<br />[0063] A fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in FIGS. 14-20 for securing a sling 302 to a shotgun 303. Similar reference numerals are used to indicate features similar to the previous described exemplary embodiments, particularly the second embodiment, except in the 300 series, e.g., &quot;3xx.&quot;<br />[0064] The attachment assembly 301 includes a fastener 304 and a locking member 305, as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. The fastener 304 is substantially similar to the fastener 204 of the third exemplary embodiment.<br />[0065] The fastener 304 has a first end 306 and a second end 307. The fastener 304 is receivable by a hole 308 in the shotgun 303 such that the first and second ends 6 and 7 are accessible on opposite sides of the shotgun, as shown in FIGS. 16-18. A first opening 309 in the fastener 304 proximal the first end 306 receives the sling 302, as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20. The locking member 305 is receivable by the second end 307 to prevent removal of the fastener 304 from the shotgun hole 308 when connected to the shotgun 303.<br />[0066] The fastener 304 has a substantially cylindrical body 310 with an enlarged head member 311 disposed at an end thereof, as shown in FIGS. 14 and 15. The enlarged head member 311 has a diameter larger than the diameter of the body 310. A first opening 309 is disposed in the enlarged head member 311. Preferably, the first opening 309 extends axially inwardly from the first end 306 of the fastener 304. As shown in FIG. 14, the first opening 309 does not extend entirely through the enlarged head member 311. The first opening 309 has a first substantially cylindrical portion 351, as shown in FIG. 14. A second portion 352 of the first opening 309 tapers inwardly. Alternatively, the first opening 309 of the enlarged head member 311 has only a substantially cylindrical portion. A groove 353 is formed in a surface of the first portion 351 of the opening 309 to facilitate receiving a pushbutton or quick connect swivel.<br />[0067] A portion 312 of the cylindrical body 110 of the fastener 304 extending rearwardly from the second end 307 of the fastener 304 is externally threaded, as shown in FIG. 14. First and second notches 313 and 314 extend circumferentially around the body 310 of the fastener 304. The first and second notches 313 and 314 are preferably disposed in the body 310 between the first and second ends 306 and 307. The fastener 304 is preferably unitarily formed as a single member and made of steel, such as 12L14 steel. Alternatively, the enlarged head member 311 can be separately formed and connected to the body 310 in any suitable manner, such as by a threaded connection. The fastener body 310 and enlarged head member 311 are preferably substantially solid members<br />[0068] The locking member 305 is a substantially cap-shaped member, as shown in FIG. 14, and is substantially similar to the locking member 105 of the second exemplary embodiment. An opening 330 extends inwardly from a first end 331 to a second end 332 of the locking member 305. The locking member opening 330 is preferably threaded. A gripping surface 333 extends circumferentially around an outer surface 334 of the locking member 305. The locking member 305 is preferably unitarily formed as a single member and made of steel, such as 12L14 steel.<br />[0069] First and second washers 318 and 319 are disposed on the body 310 of the fastener 304 to prevent damage to the shotgun 303 from the enlarged head member 311 of the fastener 304 and the first end 331 of the locking member 305. The first and second washers 318 and 319 are preferably substantially circular having openings 320 and 321 therein to receive the fastener body 310. Preferably, the first and second washers 318 and 319 have an outer diameter corresponding to the outer diameter of the enlarged head member 311 and the locking member 305, respectively. As shown in FIG. 15, the outer diameter of the first washer 318 is preferably larger than the outer diameter of the second washer 319. The first and second washers 318 and 319 are preferably made of nylon, or other suitable scratch resistant material.<br />[0070] To connect the attachment assembly 301 to a firearm, such as Mossberg or Benelli style shotguns, the first washer 318 is disposed on the body 310 of the fastener 304, as shown in FIG. 16. The first washer 318 is disposed adjacent a substantially planar surface 322 of the enlarged head member 311. The second end 307 of the fastener 304 is positioned on the shotgun's rear trigger group pin (not shown), which is located rearward of the front trigger group pin 323. A tool (not shown) is used to tap the enlarged head member 311 of the fastener 304, thereby driving the rear trigger group pin out of the shotgun 303. The rear trigger group pin can then be manually removed to provide a pin hole 308 in which the fastener 304 can be inserted. By using the rear trigger group pin, the muzzle of the shotgun 3 is raised higher from the ground, thereby facilitating carrying the shotgun and avoiding unwanted debris from entering the barrel.<br />[0071] The second end 307 of the fastener 304 is inserted in the pin hole 308 until the first washer 318 engages a first sidewall 324 of the shotgun, as shown in FIG. 17. A beveled surface 325 at the second end 307 of the fastener 304 facilitates inserting the fastener in the pin hole 308. The outer diameters of the enlarged head portion 311 and the first washer 318 are larger than the diameter of the pin hole 308, thereby limiting an insertion depth of the fastener 304 and the first washer 318 in the pin hole 308. Accordingly, movement of the fastener 304 in a first direction is limited. The first and second notches 313 and 314 engage first and second spring members 35 and 36 (FIG. 5) of the trigger group assembly, thereby further facilitating retention of the fastener 304 of the attachment assembly 301 in the shotgun 303. The first washer 318 substantially prevents the enlarged head member 311 of the fastener 304 from scratching, marring or otherwise damaging the finish of the first side wall 324 of the shotgun 303.<br />[0072] The second end 307 of the fastener 304 passes entirely through the shotgun 303 and is accessible on the second sidewall 325. The second washer 319 is disposed on the body 310 of the fastener 304 in a position abutting the second sidewall 325 of the shotgun 303.<br />[0073] An adhesive is disposed on the external threads of the threaded portion 312 of the fastener 304 prior to connecting the locking member 305 thereto. The locking member 305 is then disposed on the threaded portion 312 of the fastener 304, as shown in FIG. 18, such that the opening 330 of the locking member 305 threadably engages the threaded portion 312 of the fastener 304. The second washer 319 substantially prevents the locking member 305 from scratching, marring or otherwise damaging the finish of the second side wall 325 of the shotgun 303. The locking member 305 is threaded onto the threaded portion 312 until snug. The adhesive is allowed to set, thereby further facilitating securing the attachment assembly 301 to the shotgun 303 and preventing loosening of the threaded connection between the fastener 304 and the locking member 305.<br />[0074] The outer diameters of the locking member 305 and the second washer 319 are larger than the diameter of the pin hole 308, thereby preventing the fastener 304, the locking member 305 and the second washer 319 from being withdrawn from the pin hole 308 in a second direction. The second direction is substantially opposite to the first direction.<br />[0075] A conventional pushbutton swivel 327 of the sling 302 is inserted in the opening 309 in the enlarged head member 311 of the fastener 304 of the attachment assembly 301, as shown in FIG. 19. The swivel 327 is a quick connect type connection that quickly and easily connects to the opening 309 in the enlarged head member 311. For example, the swivel 327 can use a plurality of spring-loaded ball bearings that are received by the groove 353 in the first portion 351 of the opening 309 to securely retain the sling 302 to the attachment assembly 301. The fastener 304 is a substantially linear member, thereby increasing its strength such that the attachment assembly 301 substantially resists breaking during use. The enlarged head member 311 and the locking member 305 of the attachment assembly 301 being connected to the firearm 303 at opposite sides thereof substantially prevents wobble or other movement between the attachment assembly and the firearm. By substantially preventing such movement, warping of the pin hole 308, which can lead to a loose fitting between the attachment assembly and the firearm, is substantially eliminated.<br />[0076] Accordingly, the attachment assembly 301 can be quickly and easily connected to the shotgun 303 without requiring gunsmithing. As shown in FIG. 19, a single-point connection is used to connect the sling 302 to the shotgun 303, as is commonly used in the military. As shown in FIG. 20, a second swivel 328 is connected to an existing fastener assembly 329 connected to the shotgun 303, thereby forming a two-point connection for the sling 302.<br />[0077] The conventional pushbutton swivel 327 is shown in FIG. 21 prior to being connected to the fastener 204 of the attachment assembly 201 of the third exemplary embodiment. The swivel 327 has a plurality of ball bearings 361 that are received by the groove 253 in the enlarged head member 211, thereby securing the swivel 327 to the attachment assembly 201. A pushbutton 362 is pushed axially inwardly to release the ball bearings 351 from the groove 253, thereby allowing the swivel to be quickly detached from the fastener assembly 201.<br />[0078] The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the present invention. The description of an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is intended to be illustrative, and not to limit the scope of the present invention. Various modifications, alternatives and variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and are intended to fall within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims and their equivalents."
US-20080121652-A1,"A squirting toy is comprised of a cylindrical housing and a piston that slides within to force water into or out of the housing via a hole therein. The housing is encased within a shell creating a water impervious volume sufficient for the toy to float in water. The shell is soft, so that the gun is not a safety hazard when left floating in a swimming pool. Handles associated with one or both actuating portions of the squirting toy are provided for gripping and operating the squirting toy more effectively.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />[0014] FIG. 1 is an action view of a squirting toy showing water being expelled there-from;<br />[0015] FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view through the toy of FIG. 1 in its retracted/empty state;<br />[0016] FIG. 3 is an enlarged partial section of the toy of FIG. 1;<br />[0017] FIG. 4 is an action cross-sectional view showing the intake of water into the toy of FIG. 1;<br />[0018] FIG. 5 is an action cross-sectional view showing the expulsion of water from the toy of FIG. 1;<br />[0019] FIG. 6 is a side perspective view of an embodiment of the squirting toy of the present invention;<br />[0020] FIG. 7 is a side perspective view of an embodiment of the squirting toy of the present invention;<br />[0021] FIG. 8 is a side perspective view of an embodiment of the squirting toy of the present invention; and<br />[0022] FIG. 9 is a side elevation view of the squirting toy embodiment of FIG. 8 showing a section view of tubular housing containing piston 116 and handle portion 132 separated a distance from shell 138.<br />DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br />[0023] A preferred embodiment of the invention is shown in FIGS. 1 through 5, where there is depicted a toy 100 for squirting a water stream 102, and which is adapted to float on the water surface 104.<br />[0024] The toy 100 comprises a rigid tubular housing 106 that encloses a hollow cylindrical chamber 110. The forward end 112 of the tubular housing is closed except for a small hole 114. Piston 116 slides longitudinally within chamber 110 and is sealed against the cylindrical inner surface 120 of the chamber by o-ring 122, which is seated within groove 125 of the piston. The piston separates the chamber 110 into a forward portion 110A and a rear portion 110B. The piston 116 is rigidly connected to shaft 124 at the forward end 126 thereof. Slide bushing 128 supports shaft 124 at the rear end 130 of the tubular housing 106, while allowing longitudinal movement relative thereto. Handle portion 132 is rigidly connected to shaft 124 at the rearward end 134 thereof. Expansion of the handle portion 132 relative to the tubular housing 106, while hole 114 is below the water surface 104, as depicted in FIG. 4, causes water to be inhaled into the expanding forward chamber portion 110A, through hole 114. Subsequent retraction of the handle portion 132 relative to the tubular housing 106 causes that water to be exhaled through hole 114 in a powerful stream 102.<br />[0025] Tubular shell 138, preferably made of closed-cell polyethylene foam, surrounds tubular housing 106, to provide both a soft protective surface and buoyancy. Other materials may be substituted for polyethylene foam, such as ethylene vinyl acetate closed-cell foam.<br />[0026] FIGS. 8 and 9 show an alternative embodiment of the squirting toy invention. The encapsulating shell 138 of FIG. 9 is a thin material, e.g. a polymer, that defines a toroidal space between an inside surface of the encapsulating shell 138 and the outside surface of housing 106. Encapsulating shell 138 prevents water from entering toroidal space 152 and provides buoyancy when toy 100 is in a pool or other body or water even when housing 106 is filled with liquid.<br />[0027] In a most preferred embodiment, encapsulating shell 138 is formed from a material and of wall thickness to provide flexibility and `softness` to the encapsulating shell. Examples of such materials include polyethylene terephthalate (PET or PETE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE). Materials and wall thickness parameters similar to those of standard carbonated beverage bottles will provide sufficient `softness` to form a safe squirting toy, i.e. the toy 100 having encapsulating shell 138 of the most preferred embodiment will not injure a person hit with the toy at typical velocities. Encapsulating shell 138 may be supported at one or more points along its length by a shell support 150. Alternatively, a much thinner wall thickness may be chosen and the toroidal space slightly pressurized. Proper choice of pressure will result in encapsulating shell 138 maintaining a selected 3-dimensional shape while remaining soft enough to offer safety benefits.<br />[0028] In another preferred embodiment of the squirting toy, encapsulating shell 138 may be transparent, semi-transparent or translucent. Such a preferred embodiment is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9.<br />[0029] Handle portion 132 may include handle shell 140, which is preferable made of the same foam, and is rigidly connected shaft 124 by means of support bushings 144 and 146. Alternatively, other materials having sufficient buoyancy, softness, and water impermeability, such as polyurethane foam, may be used for both the tubular and handle shells. The shells may also be blow molded or rotationally molded air-filled cylindrical bladders or similar materials, as illustrated by encapsulating shell 32 in FIGS. 8 and 9. The handle shell 140 may also be made of solid material as long as sufficient buoyancy is provided by the tubular shell.<br />[0030] A most preferred embodiment of the present invention has the squirting toy emulating a &quot;swimming noodle&quot;, well known in the context of recreational water activities. When the handle portion is retracted, as in FIG. 2, the shell 138 and handle shell 140 may form a cylinder of round, elliptical, square, polygon, oval or irregular cross-section. In a most preferred embodiment, shell 138 and handle shell 140 are of identical outside shape and are formed from closed-cell polymer foam, thus creating a similar appearance and feel to those of a common &quot;swimming noodle&quot;. This emulated swimming noodle may be of any cross-sectional shape, e.g. round, polygonal, elliptical, oval, or some combination of shapes including generally polygonal with rounded sides.<br />[0031] FIG. 6 shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention. Toy 100 comprises a housing 106 enclosing a chamber 110, the forward end 112 of the housing having a small hole 114. Piston 116 slides within and is sealed against the cylindrical inner surface 120 of the chamber 110. A shaft retainer 142 is connected to shaft 124 at the rearward end 134 thereof. Shaft retainer 142 further comprises a handle 132A. Handle 132A, in a preferred embodiment, is shaped such that it has a palm surface 135 and a finger surface 136, i.e. surfaces molded to receive respective portions of a hand. Gripping handle 132A allows a user to operate shaft 124 and piston 116 as described above.<br />[0032] In a more preferred embodiment, one of either the housing 106 or the shell 138 has a handle 132B extending therefrom. Handle 132B may also have a palm surface 135 and a finger surface 136. Grasping both handle 132A and 132B and forcing them away from one another while hole 114 is below the water surface 104 causes water to be inhaled into the expanding forward chamber portion 110A through hole 114. Subsequent forcing of handles 132A and 132B toward one another causes water in chamber portion 110A to be exhaled through hole 114 in a powerful stream 102.<br />[0033] In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the handle portion of squirting toy 100 may take a fanciful form. An example is shown schematically in FIG. 7. Examples of the shape of the handle 148 include: an animal head; a cartoon character head; a person's head;<br />[0034] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the applicable arts that the foregoing is merely one of many possible embodiments of the invention, and that the invention should therefore only be limited according to the following claims."
US-20060063136-A1,"A bolt locking assembly for a weapon simulator, the weapon simulator having a bolt affixed to a firearm housing providing recoil to the user. The bolt is connected to a piston housed in a piston chamber inside the housing. A gas supply provides a compressed gas or fluid into the piston chamber to generate movement and recoil of the piston. After the weapon simulator has been fired a predetermined number of times, the bolt locking assembly will obstruct operation of the bolt and piston. The bolt locking assembly includes a lock actuator port engaging the piston chamber, a locking apparatus positioned within the housing proximate the bolt, and a lock channel between said lock actuator port and said locking arm, wherein the lock channel directs gas to said locking apparatus to actuate said locking apparatus and fix the bolt in place.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS <br />[0018]  An apparatus embodying features of the claimed invention are depicted in the accompanying drawing which form a portion of this disclosure and wherein:<br />[0019]  FIG. 1 is a partial sectional side view of the weapon simulator having a bolt locking assembly of the present invention; and<br />[0020]  FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the distribution of a gas or liquid from a gas supply to the bolt locking assembly of the present invention.<br />DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT <br />[0021]  Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the present invention of a bolt locking assembly 12 for a firearm or weapon simulator 10 is illustrated. As shown, the weapon simulator 10 incorporates a housing or frame 11 surrounding a regulated gas supply 2 and including a pilot valve 4 and a recoil valve 6 to cycle the weapon simulator 10 and actuate a slide or bolt 18 affixed to the housing 11 upon the firing of the weapon simulator 10 by a user. The action of the bolt 18 is sufficient to generate substantial recoil for the user to imitate the actual use of a conventional firearm. Specifically, the weapon simulator 10 includes a piston 16 that is housed within a piston chamber 20, with the piston 16 being connected through the housing 11 to the bolt 18 of the weapon simulator 10. When fired, the gas supply 2 will provide a gas flow within the piston chamber 20 to create a forceful movement of the piston 16 within the piston chamber 20. This movement of the piston 16 will simultaneously generate movement of the bolt 18 to create recoil.<br />[0022]  The bolt locking assembly 12 of the present invention is used in conjunction with the weapon simulator 10 to provide a simple means for locking the bolt 18 using the gas supply 2 directed to creating recoil in the weapon simulator 10. That is, the weapon simulator 10 includes the bolt locking assembly 12 that is controlled by the same pilot valve 4 and gas supply 2 that controls the recoil operation of the bolt 18 of the weapon simulator 10. As a result, the need for a separate slide/bolt lock valve as required in other weapon simulator designs described above is eliminated, thus further reducing the number of components needed for realistic operation of the weapon simulator 10.<br />[0023]  The bolt locking assembly 12 includes a lock actuator port 14 that is connected to a locking assembly via a lock channel 26. The locking assembly 12 preferably includes a locking arm 17 that is pivotally mounted within the housing 11 on a pivot pin 22 and means for actuating the locking arm 17. The actuating means of the present invention include an actuating arm 25, an actuating plate 24, and a plate chamber 28, although it is foreseen that other actuating designs may be incorporated. Continuing to view FIG. 1, the actuating arm 25 is connected to the locking arm 17, with the actuating plate 24 attached to the opposite end of the locking arm 17. The actuating plate 24 is slidably mounted within a plate chamber 28 that is connected via lock channel 26 to a lock actuator port 14. The lock actuator port 14 is further opens to the piston chamber 20.<br />[0024]  In operation, the user engages a switch 30, such as a conventional firearm trigger, to prompt the firing of the weapon simulator 10. A recoil valve 6 allows a compressed gas or fluid to flow inside the piston chamber 20 to force the bolt 18 toward the user of the weapon simulator 10, thereby generating recoil by the weapon simulator 10. In such cases, the piston 16 will generally travel in the piston chamber 20 to position A.<br />[0025]  A sensor, controller or other related component 3 will monitor the number of times the weapon simulator 10 is fired. Once the weapon simulator 10 has been fired a predetermined number of times, the bolt locking assembly 12 will be set in operation. In particular, the recoil valve 6 will remain open for a preset amount of time, such that the compressed gas or fluid from the gas supply 2 will force the piston 16 to travel in the piston chamber 20 to position B, past the bolt lock actuator port 14. Once the piston 16 is beyond the lock actuator port 14, the gas applying a force on the piston 16 will flow from the piston chamber 20 through the lock actuator port 14 and lock channel 26 into the plate chamber 28. Furthermore, the compressed gas will apply pressure to the actuating plate 24, thereby concomitantly driving the actuator arm 25. The actuator arm 25 will thereby pivot the locking arm 17 about the pivot pin 22 such the locking arm 17 will be proximate a shoulder 23 of the bolt 18. As the recoil valve 6 closes, the bolt 18 will be drawn back to the original resting position, and the shoulder 23 will engage the locking arm 17.

The embodiments of the present disclosure are capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. As such, the language used herein is intended to be given the broadest possible scope and meaning; and the embodiments are meant to be exemplary, not exhaustive. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting unless otherwise indicated as so. Moreover, in the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a more thorough understanding of the disclosure. However, it will be apparent to a person having ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments of the present disclosure may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, features which are well known to persons of ordinary skill in the art have not been described in detail to avoid unnecessary complication of the description.<br />(10) Unless otherwise defined herein, scientific and technical terms used in connection with the embodiments of the present disclosure shall have the meanings that are commonly understood by those having ordinary skill in the art. Further, unless otherwise required by context, singular terms shall include pluralities and plural terms shall include the singular.<br />(11) All patents, published patent applications, and non-patent publications referenced in any portion of this application are herein expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety to the same extent as if each individual patent or publication was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference.<br />(12) As utilized in accordance with the concepts of the present disclosure, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, shall be understood to have the following meanings.<br />(13) The use of the word “a” or “an” when used in conjunction with the term “comprising” in the claims and/or the specification may mean “one,” but it is also consistent with the meaning of “one or more,” “at least one,” and “one or more than one.” The use of the term “or” in the claims and/or the specification is used to mean “and/or” unless explicitly indicated to refer to alternatives only or when the alternatives are mutually exclusive, although the disclosure supports a definition that refers to only alternatives and “and/or.” The use of the term “at least one” will be understood to include one as well as any quantity more than one, including but not limited to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, or any integer inclusive therein. The term “at least one” may extend up to 100 or 1000 or more, depending on the term to which it is attached; in addition, the quantities of 100/1000 are not to be considered limiting, as higher limits may also produce satisfactory results. In addition, the use of the term “at least one of X, Y and Z” will be understood to include X alone, Y alone, and Z alone, as well as any combination of X, Y, and Z.<br />(14) As used in this specification and claim(s), the words “comprising” (and any form of comprising, such as “comprise” and “comprises”), “having” (and any form of having, such as “have” and “has”), “including” (and any form of including, such as “includes” and “include”) or “containing” (and any form of containing, such as “contains” and “contain”) are inclusive or open-ended and do not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.<br />(15) The term “or combinations thereof” as used herein refers to all permutations and combinations of the listed items preceding the term. For example, “A, B, C, or combinations thereof” is intended to include at least one of: A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, or ABC, and if order is important in a particular context, also BA, CA, CB, CBA, BCA, ACB, BAC, or CAB. Continuing with this example, expressly included are combinations that contain repeats of one or more item or term, such as BB, AAA, AAB, BBC, AAABCCCC, CBBAAA, CABABB, and so forth. The skilled artisan will understand that typically there is no limit on the number of items or terms in any combination, unless otherwise apparent from the context.<br />(16) Throughout this application, the term “about” is used to indicate that a value includes the inherent variation of error that exists among the study subjects. Further, in this detailed description, each numerical value (e.g., temperature or time) should be read once as modified by the term “about” (unless already expressly so modified), and then read again as not so modified unless otherwise indicated in context. Also, any range listed or described herein is intended to include, implicitly or explicitly, any number within the range, particularly all integers, including the end points, and is to be considered as having been so stated. For example, “a range from 1 to 10” is to be read as indicating each possible number, particularly integers, along the continuum between about 1 and about 10. Thus, even if specific data points within the range, or even no data points within the range, are explicitly identified or specifically referred to, it is to be understood that any data points within the range are to be considered to have been specified, and that the inventors possessed knowledge of the entire range and the points within the range. Further, an embodiment having a feature characterized by the range does not have to be achieved for every value in the range, but can be achieved for just a subset of the range. For example, where a range covers units 1-10, the feature specified by the range could be achieved for only units 4-6 in a particular embodiment.<br />(17) As used herein, the term “substantially” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance completely occurs or that the subsequently described event or circumstance occurs to a great extent or degree. For example, the term “substantially” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance occurs at least 90% of the time, or at least 95% of the time, or at least 98% of the time.<br />(18) Referring to the Figures, and in particular to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an exemplary unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> for remotely disorienting a subject. The unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> supplies a medium to be received by and stimulate at least one exteroceptive sensor of the subject at a level sufficient to temporarily disorient the subject. Exemplary subjects include human or non-human animals. Examples of non-human animals including a dog, a cat, a coyote, a wolf, a mountain lion, or the like.<br />(19) Exemplary exteroceptive sensors include eyes, nerves involving a sense of touch, ears, tastebuds, and nose. Generally, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> is configured to provide the medium to the subject without endangering the operator or persons in surrounding environments. The unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may follow a flight path above and/or about the subject at a relatively close distance avoiding obstacles such as a tower, antenna, wire, and/or the like. Additionally, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may be configured to output 2D images, or three dimensional or two dimensional files (e.g., CAD files) of the subject for identification, operator monitoring and/or other purposes.<br />(20) In some embodiments, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may comprise a medium source <b>14</b>, collision detection and avoidance system <b>16</b>, an aerial platform <b>18</b>, onboard data processing and transmission system <b>20</b>, a control system <b>22</b>, and a piloting system <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may further include a distance sensor <b>25</b> configured to measure a distance between the aerial platform <b>18</b> and the subject. The distance sensor <b>25</b> may measure the distance between the aerial platform <b>18</b> and the subject when the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> is in use and/or for each period in which the medium source <b>14</b> is actuated to produce the medium, for example. Generally, each element of the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may be used to disorient the subject. For example, using the piloting system <b>24</b>, a user may pilot the aerial platform <b>18</b> via a remote control system <b>51</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>), virtual reality, augmented reality, smartphone (e.g., iPhone), tablet, joystick, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may be piloted autonomously (i.e., user direction may be optional). One or more cameras (e.g., stereoscopic camera, standard camera, 360 degree camera, combinations thereof, or the like) on the aerial platform <b>18</b> may present one or more views of the environment to the user. For example, the user may be provided one or more views of a natural environment for positioning and/or moving the aerial platform <b>18</b> around the subject. The virtual or augmented reality may allow for the user to observe the subject and/or the environment from the point of view of the aerial platform <b>18</b>, as if the user is on the aerial platform <b>18</b>. Additionally, virtual or augmented reality may provide the user additional information about flight and/or operating status of the aerial platform <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the user may utilize a radio-frequency control module configured to transmit commands to the aerial platform <b>18</b> during flight of the aerial platform <b>18</b>. The nature of the commands may depend on flying and/or propulsion mechanism in use by the aerial platform <b>18</b>, including, but not limited to, multiple rotors (e.g., quad or octo-rotor), jet propulsion, a fixed wing with one or more propellers (not shown), or non-fixed wing with multiple rotors <b>25</b> which are labeled in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> with the reference numerals <b>26</b><i>a</i>, <b>26</b><i>b</i>, <b>26</b><i>c </i>and <b>26</b><i>d</i>, or the like. It should be noted that any suitable number of rotors <b>26</b> can be provided, such as 4, 6 or 8, for example.<br />(21) Once the aerial platform <b>18</b> is in flight, the medium source <b>14</b> may be used to emit the medium to disorient the subject, assist in piloting the aerial platform <b>18</b>, or illuminate the subject. The medium source <b>14</b> may include an optical source <b>28</b> capable of projecting electromagnetic energy (e.g., visible light) onto the subject and preferably into the eyes and/or on the face of the subject. The medium source <b>14</b> may use other types of mediums, such as sound, thermal energy, or the like, to temporarily disorient the subject. An optical sensor <b>32</b> of the medium source <b>14</b> may record data of the illumination (i.e., projection of the optical pattern <b>30</b>) on the subject. The mounting of the optical source <b>28</b> and the optical sensor <b>32</b> on the aerial platform <b>18</b> may provide the rigidity to ensure that the optical source <b>28</b> and the optical sensor <b>32</b> remain in the same geometrical relationship (i.e., static geometrical relationship) with each other without significant movement during and/or between recording events. Additionally, such mounting may be lightweight to avoid consuming payload capacity of the aerial platform <b>18</b>.<br />(22) The data obtained from the optical sensor <b>32</b> may be used to locate the subject and direct the piloting system <b>24</b> to aim the optical source <b>28</b>. For example, the control system <b>22</b> can be programmed with a facial recognition algorithm to scan one or more image depicting the subject that is generated by the optical sensor <b>32</b> to locate the face and/or eyes of the subject within the images. Once the face and/or eyes of the subject is located, the control system <b>22</b> would provide suitable instructions to the piloting system <b>24</b> to move the position and/or orientation of the aerial platform <b>18</b> (and/or a gimbal connected to the aerial platform <b>18</b> and the optical sensor <b>32</b>) to aim the medium generated by the optical source at the face and/or eyes of the subject. Other types of recognition programs can be used depending upon the type of medium to be provided. For example, for sound, the recognition program may look for the subject's head or ears. In some embodiments, the distance between the optical source <b>28</b> and the optical sensor <b>32</b>, angular orientation of the optical source <b>28</b> and the optical sensor <b>32</b> can be fixed or dynamic. In some embodiments, the optical source <b>28</b> may illuminate the subject in a strobed fashion, or with a series of different optical patterns. For example, the colors of the light can be changed to further disorient the subject. During the illumination series, the user may attempt to maintain the aerial platform <b>18</b> at a stationary position, or the piloting system may be controlled to follow the subject.<br />(23) In some embodiments, an optional external optical source <b>34</b> may provide additional medium(s) aimed at the subject to disorient the subject. An exemplary external optical source <b>34</b> may be a flashlight operated by a police officer. Such scans may provide data on the environment surrounding the subject, to assist in aiming the optical source <b>28</b> at the face, head, eyes or ears, of the subject. For example, the control system <b>22</b> may be programmed to determine the location of where the additional medium is pointing by using information obtained from the optical sensor <b>32</b>, and provide control instructions to the piloting system <b>24</b>. The information from the external optical source <b>34</b> can also be used to avoid collisions with the subject and/or interfering objects that may damage, incapacitate and/or destroy the aerial platform <b>18</b>.<br />(24) The control system <b>22</b> may generally coordinate the operation of the medium source <b>14</b>, the collision detection and avoidance system <b>16</b>, the onboard data processing and transmission system <b>20</b> and the distance sensor <b>25</b>. For example, for the medium source <b>14</b>, the control system <b>22</b> may determine the number of strobes per second, illumination time for each strobe, and/or the time at which the optical sensor <b>32</b> may sample and/or store the output for further processing and/or transmission. The control system <b>22</b> may obtain input from the collision detection and avoidance system <b>16</b> and either alert the user when the aerial platform <b>18</b> may be at a pre-determined distance to the subject or interfering object, thus allowing the user to decide appropriate action. In some embodiments, the control system <b>22</b> may signal the aerial platform <b>18</b> to take rapid evasive action independent of the user.<br />(25) In some embodiments, the onboard data processing and transmission system <b>20</b> may perform initial electronic processing in preparation for transmission to a collection station <b>40</b>. Such processing may include, but is not limited to, data compression, preliminary registration (e.g., compensation for movement of the aerial platform <b>18</b> between captures), encapsulation of data in a format used by a transmission link, and/or the like.<br />(26) In some embodiments, a transmitter <b>42</b> (e.g., RF transmitter) of the onboard data processing and transmission system <b>20</b> may transmit the processed data to the collection station <b>40</b>. For example, the transmitter <b>42</b> may transmit the processed data to the collection station via a network <b>44</b> and/or cloud. Such network <b>44</b> may be implemented as the World Wide Web (or Internet), a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a metropolitan network, a wireless network, a cellular network, a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) network, a code division multiple access (CDMS) network, a 3G network, a 4G network, a 5G network, a satellite network, a radio network, an optical network, a cable network, a public switched telephone network, an Ethernet network, combinations thereof, and/or the like. It is conceivable that in the near future, embodiments of the present disclosure may use more advanced networking topologies.<br />(27) Location of the collection station <b>40</b> may include, but is not limited to, a vehicle, building, or other stationary object, or a second aerial vehicle (e.g., airplane). Within the collection station <b>40</b>, or within a second location in communication with the collection station <b>40</b>, a receiver may collect and/or retrieve the processed data sent by the transmitter <b>42</b>.<br />(28) Thus, in some embodiments, the optical source <b>28</b> may be strobed or modulated between a first state (e.g., on) and a second state having a reduced intensity relative to the first state (e.g., off). The control system <b>22</b> may modulate the optical source <b>28</b> between 5 and 25 hz. The optical source <b>28</b> may be mounted on an unmanned aerial platform <b>18</b>, which offers some distinct advantages as compared to tactical personnel directly holding the light. Since the aerial platform <b>18</b> can be positioned away from tactical personnel, the remotely modulated light would give tactical personnel a relatively safe period to act. The remotely positioned light would also put law enforcement in the peripheral vision of the subject (e.g., aggressor) who's peripheral vision has been desensitized by the strobe thereby giving law enforcement a tactical advantage to take action or not be detected.<br />(29) The optical source <b>28</b> can be any light emitting device that can be rapidly modulated. LED(s) and laser(s) are ideal candidates. These optical sources can be aimed at the face/eyes, which can be accomplished manually by the user sending instructions to the piloting system <b>24</b>, or automatically using facial recognition algorithms to locate the subject's face/eyes in images obtained by the optical sensor <b>32</b>. The aerial platform <b>18</b> can then accurately aim the strobed light for maximum localized effect while using a minimum beam size.<br />(30) The control system <b>22</b> may use any computational algorithm existing for identification of objects of interest in images collected by the optical sensor <b>32</b> and such computation algorithm may be stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium. Generally, the control system <b>22</b> may include one or more processors coupled with the non-transitory computer readable medium, and configured to automatically execute this methodology to identify and/or obtain information about objects of interest for a variety of purposes.<br />(31) The control system <b>22</b> may include one or more processors. The term “processor” will include multiple processors unless the term “processor” is limited by a singular term, such as “only one processor”. In some embodiments, the processor may be partially or completely network-based or cloud-based. The processor may or may not be located in a single physical location. Additionally, multiple processors may or may not be necessarily located in a single physical location.<br />(32) The processor may include, but are not limited to, implementation as a variety of different types of systems, such as a digital signal processor (DSP), a central processing unit (CPU), a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a microprocessor, a multi-core processor, a quantum processor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a graphics processing unit (GPU), a visual processing unit (VPU), combinations thereof, and/or the like.<br />(33) The processor may be capable of reading and/or executing executable code stored in the one or more non-transitory processor readable medium and/or of creating, manipulating, altering, and/or storing computer data structures into the one or more non-transitory processor readable medium. The non-transitory processor readable medium may be implemented as any type of memory, such as random access memory (RAM), a CD-ROM, a hard drive, a solid state drive, a flash drive, a memory card, a DVD-ROM, a floppy disk, an optical drive, and combinations thereof, for example. The non-transitory readable medium may be located in the same physical location as the processor, or located remotely from the processor and may communicate via a network. The physical location of the non-transitory processor readable medium may be varied, and may be implemented as a “cloud memory”, i.e., one or more non-transitory processor readable medium may be partially, or completely based on or accessed via a network.<br />(34) In some embodiments, the control system <b>22</b> may be configured to receive additional data from one or more external sources. In some embodiments, the external source may be user inputted data. In some embodiments, the external source <b>64</b> may be data associated with a third party system (e.g., weather, GPS satellite). The information may be provided via a network or input device, including, but not limited to, a keyboard, touchscreen, mouse, trackball, microphone, fingerprint reader, infrared port, slide-out keyboard, flip-out keyboard, call phone, PDA, video game controller, remote control, fax machine, network interface, speech recognition, gesture recognition, eye tracking, brain-computer interface, combinations thereof, and/or the like.<br />(35) In some embodiments, prior to movement of the aerial platform <b>18</b>, a user may provide the control system <b>22</b> with some or all parameters to aid the CDAS system <b>16</b> in navigation. Parameters may include, but are not limited to, information identifying the subject, suggested flight path, estimated height of subject. The CDAS system <b>16</b> may include AI software configured to navigate the aerial platform <b>18</b> based on parameters, received data from environment mapping, extracted data from scanning data processed onboard or provided via network from a user, and/or the like.<br />(36) The aerial platform <b>18</b> may be configured to support and move the medium source <b>14</b>, CDAS <b>16</b>, onboard processing and transmission system <b>20</b>, control system <b>22</b>, and piloting system <b>24</b> within the air. Generally, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may be configured to move at a predetermined low speed (e.g., 1 km/h). Additionally, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may be configured to hover (i.e., remain stationary) within the air. For example, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may be configured to move at a low speed or hover as the optical source <b>28</b> is aimed at the subject or the optical sensor <b>32</b> obtains sensor data of the subject. The aerial platform <b>18</b> may also include load capacity permitting unimpeded aerial navigation while transporting the medium source <b>14</b> and CAS <b>16</b>. Further, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may be configured to carry fuel to sustain long periods of flight (e.g., 2 hours) prior to refueling to minimize time to complete a scanning process for the structure <b>12</b>.<br />(37) Generally, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may include one or more mechanical platforms, one or more propulsion systems, and one or more mounting systems. The piloting system <b>24</b> may aid in providing direction to the one or more propulsion systems <b>52</b> or the mounting system <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, the mounting system <b>54</b> may be connected between the optical sensor <b>32</b> and the mechanical platform <b>50</b> such that the mechanical platform <b>50</b> prevents the optical sensor <b>32</b> from hitting the ground when the aerial platform <b>18</b> lands. In some embodiments, the mounting system <b>54</b> may include a gimbal for moving the optical sensor <b>32</b> relative to the mechanical platform <b>50</b>.<br />(38) In some embodiments, the propulsion system <b>52</b> may include two or more rotors <b>26</b> (e.g., helicopter, quadcopter, octocopter). In some embodiments, the four or more rotors <b>26</b> may be attached to electric motors <b>27</b> (only one of which is numbered in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>) for rotating the rotors <b>26</b>. In some embodiments, relative rotational velocity of the four or more rotors <b>26</b> may be configured to control direction and/or speed of flight of the aerial platform <b>18</b>. By controlling the relative rotational velocity of the four or more rotors <b>26</b>, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may obtain slow and/or stationary flight (i.e., hovering), and may operate for extended periods of time. The aerial platform <b>18</b> may include other configurations of the propulsion system <b>52</b> configured to utilize different placement and/or propulsion providing slow and/or stationary flight.<br />(39) In some embodiments, the aerial platform <b>18</b> may include one or more power sources (not shown). The power sources may include one or more supplies of power to at least one or more electric loads on the aerial platform <b>18</b>. The one or more power sources may include, but are not limited to electrical, solar, mechanical, or chemical energy. For example, in some embodiments, fuel may be used to power one or more components of the aerial platform <b>18</b>. Additionally, one or more batteries may be included as one or more power sources for the aerial platform <b>18</b>.<br />(40) In some embodiments, a diameter of the medium generated by the medium source <b>14</b> can be automatically adjusted to a minimum effective size relative to the size which is proportionate to the size of the face and distance from the light source.<br />(41) In some embodiments, the disorientation system may be provided with two or more medium sources <b>14</b>. For example, one of the medium sources <b>14</b> can be used to provide a modulated light source, and another one of the medium sources <b>14</b> may be used to generate a colocated sound to further draw attention to the aerial platform <b>18</b> and further disorient the subject.<br />(42) The control system <b>22</b> of the aerial platform <b>18</b> may be programmed to provide instructions to the piloting system <b>24</b> in a way that moves the aerial platform <b>18</b> to offer a tactical advantage. One such movement would be in a direction that draws attention progressively away from the tactical team. Another pattern would be for the aerial platform to automatically move to a position furthest from the tactical team thereby drawing attention away from the team.<br />(43) In some embodiments, coordinated strobe patterns from multiple aerial platforms could give the illusion of movement and further confuse the subject.<br />(44) In use, the aerial platform <b>18</b> is piloted near a subject, and the medium source <b>14</b> is aimed at the subject and actuated as discussed above. In some embodiments, the medium source <b>14</b> can be actuated to generate the medium prior to aiming the medium source <b>14</b> at the subject.<br />(45) High-temperature survivability is a critical capability when using unmanned vehicles in certain situations such as fire-fighting. However, the construction of most previous vehicles, such as unmanned aerial vehicles is not ideal for such high-temperature environments. To improve the survivability of these vehicles, several inventive approaches can be taken as described below.<br />(46) First, in an exemplary embodiment the mechanical platform <b>50</b> includes a housing <b>60</b> surrounding electronics and other components forming the avoidance system <b>16</b>, the transmission system <b>20</b>, the control system <b>22</b>, the piloting system <b>24</b>, and the transmitter <b>42</b>. Components of these systems which should be exposed to the environment around the housing, such as certain types of sensors, may be provided through an opening in the housing <b>60</b>. As explained in more detail below, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> includes a temperature buffer <b>70</b> around the electronics. The temperature buffer <b>70</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>) is configured to protect the electronics from temperatures outside of the housing <b>60</b> above maximum thermal operating characteristics of the electronics. The temperature buffer <b>70</b> can be constructed of a material configured to reflect electromagnetic wavelengths in a range of 500 um to 2 um, an insulating material, a cooling material, a phase change material and combinations thereof.<br />(47) In use, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may be exposed to fire and is subjected to significant radiative heat transfer. The radiative heat transfer can be minimized by covering the vehicle's components, including the housing <b>60</b> with IR-reflective materials that reflect wavelengths in the 500 um to 2 um range. One applicable covering or construction material is aluminum. This material can be applied directly to the underlying structure, such as the housing <b>60</b> or can be stood off slightly to act as a radiative heat shield.<br />(48) A second approach to reducing temperature rise in the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> is to incorporate phase change materials (PCM) into the construction of the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b>. Initially, solid-liquid PCMs behave like sensible heat storage (SHS) materials. The temperature of the phase change material rises as the phase change material absorbs heat. When PCMs reach the temperature at which they change phase (the PCM's melting temperature) the PCM absorb large amounts of heat and remain at an almost constant temperature. The PCM continues to absorb heat without a significant rise in temperature until all the PCM is transformed to the liquid phase. Long chain paraffin wax is one such material that changes phase at moderate temperatures and could be used to absorb heat. Another alternative is water. Liquid water stored in the mechanical platform <b>50</b> must be boiled before the surrounding structure temperature can rise above 100 C which is still cool enough to protect most electronics, including integrated circuitry. Thus, temperature sensitive components of the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b>, such as electronics within the avoidance system <b>16</b>, the transmission system <b>20</b>, the control system <b>22</b>, the piloting system <b>24</b>, the transmitter <b>42</b>, and any motor(s) driving the rotors <b>26</b> can be surrounded by a container containing the PCM. Ice is another example of a phase change material in which the ice transforming from solid to liquid is an option. Further, another material, such as chilled water or an antifreeze liquid can be passed across the ice and throughout sensitive components of the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b>. The container can be designed to have an inlet or outlet, so that the PCM can be removable and replaced with fresh PCM. In some embodiments, this can be accomplished by implementing the container holding the PCM as a replaceable cartridge. The time it takes to transform all of the PCM adds to a safe operating time that the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> can be exposed to extreme heat. Once all of the PCM material has changed phase, it must be “regenerated” by waiting for the PCM to cool. Alternately onboard water could be sprayed onto sensitive components for cooling or atomized water could be delivered to external vehicle components to take advantage of evaporative cooling. Water can also be stored in the vehicle in a frozen state which then requires a great deal of energy absorption to transition the material through two phase changes prior to the protected structures exceeding 100 degrees C.<br />(49) Sensitive components may also be insulated with a suitable insulating material, such as an aerogel which offers tremendous insulating properties with minimal weight. Aerogel typically has a density between 0.0011 to 0.5 g cm-3, with a typical average of around 0.020 g cm-3. This means that aerogel is usually only 15 times heavier than air, and has been produced at a density of only 3 times that of air. A typical silica aerogel has a total thermal conductivity of ˜0.017 W/mK. Temperature sensitive components of the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b>, such as electronics within the avoidance system <b>16</b>, the transmission system <b>20</b>, the control system <b>22</b>, the piloting system <b>24</b>, the transmitter <b>42</b>, and any motor(s) driving the rotors <b>26</b> (especially those that generate little heat) can survive longer in hot environments when protected with such materials.<br />(50) The temperature of the rotors <b>26</b>, being thin and lightweight, is also considered when maximizing vehicle operating longevity at high temperatures. Unmitigated, the rotor temperature will quickly reach ambient temperatures due to the thin, lightweight structure and enhanced convective heat transfer resulting from the rotor's velocity through the air. The rotors <b>26</b> can be constructed from heat resistant materials such as graphene, graphite, or carbon nanotubes (i.e. Miralon). Another approach to cooling the rotor <b>26</b> is by pumping a cool, or liquid phase changing material through one or more blade(s) of the rotors <b>26</b> in flight. In some embodiments, this can be accomplished by passing cooled air (e.g. air passed across the PCM) through passages in the rotors <b>26</b>.<br />(51) The optical sensor <b>32</b>, such as a thermal camera and other electronics, may also be sensitive to heat. In this case, heat levels elevated above an operating temperature range of the optical sensor <b>32</b> affects the optical sensor's ability to function and generate high-quality images. These components can be cooled with a liquid or gas. For example, these components can be cooled with water from an onboard ice bath which increases the performance of the optical sensor <b>32</b>. The optical sensor <b>32</b> may be configured to detect and form images of energy in a longwave infrared having a wavelength between 6 um to 12 um. The optical sensor <b>32</b> may be cooled by the phase change material, such as water. Printed circuit boards and their associated components can be cooled by a similar means. Internal cavities can be used to carry cooled liquid inside the printed circuit board thereby cooling the board and key components. In some embodiments, the unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> may include an atomizer (not shown) on the mechanical platform <b>50</b>, and a fluid delivery system (not shown) connected to the atomizer and configured to supply a fluid to the atomizer, whereby atomized fluid can be released outside of the mechanical platform <b>50</b> during flight of the aerial platform <b>18</b> to create a cooler operating environment.<br />(52) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref>, a surveillance device <b>100</b> for performing surveillance through a material <b>102</b> (e.g., window, wall, or the like) that may be delivered and/or part of an unmanned aerial vehicle such as unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> is described. In general, the surveillance device <b>100</b> may be provided with a portable housing <b>104</b>, a mounting assembly <b>106</b> (such as a suction cup), accessory package <b>108</b>, a wireless transceiver <b>110</b>, a power supply <b>112</b>, and electronics <b>114</b> configured to control the surveillance device <b>100</b>. The portable housing <b>104</b> has a rear face <b>116</b>, a front face <b>118</b>, and a peripheral side wall <b>120</b> formed therebetween. The mounting assembly <b>106</b> is connected to the housing <b>104</b> and extends from the front face <b>118</b> of the housing <b>104</b>. The mounting assembly <b>106</b> is configured to connect the housing <b>104</b> to the material <b>102</b> in a predetermined orientation. The accessory package <b>108</b> may be provided with a controller <b>122</b> and at least one illumination device <b>124</b> to selectively emit a predetermined light spectrum in an emission path.<br />(53) The predetermined orientation and the emission path are selected such that the emission path passes through the material <b>102</b> upon connecting the housing <b>104</b> to the material <b>102</b> in the predetermined orientation. The wireless transceiver <b>110</b> is coupled to the accessory package <b>108</b>, and is configured to receive wireless instructions and pass the wireless instructions to the controller <b>122</b> of the accessory package <b>108</b>. The first wireless instruction instructing the controller <b>122</b> to actuate the illumination device <b>124</b>. The power supply <b>112</b> is mounted in the housing <b>104</b> and is configured to supply electrical power. The power supply leads are constructed of a conductive material, and connected to terminals on the power supply <b>112</b>. The power supply leads are connected to the accessory package <b>108</b> and the wireless transceiver <b>110</b> whereby power applied to the power supply leads is supplied to the controller <b>122</b>, the at least one emission device <b>124</b> and the wireless transceiver <b>110</b>.<br />(54) In some embodiments, the portable housing <b>104</b> is in the form of a dart having a shape that reduces drag from air moving past the portable housing <b>104</b>. In other embodiments, the portable housing <b>104</b> is in the form of a drone body. The material <b>102</b> can be a window, and the predetermined light spectrum includes light that is visible to a human. The mounting assembly <b>106</b> may be, but is not limited to, a suction cup, an adhesive strip, tape, glue, or other tacky substances, for example.<br />(55) Examples of accessories that could be include in the accessory package <b>108</b> include: Microphones—including various types such as contact microphones having a probe to contact the material (window or wall); a laser microphone that uses a laser beam to sense vibration within the material; or an acoustic microphone that uses a sensor to detect vibrations passing within air. Cameras (may include artificial intelligence/image recognition to sense and identify movements). The cameras may also be configured to receive and interpret mediums other than visible light, such as an infrared portion or millimeter band electromagnetic waves of the electromagnetic spectrum. Motion detectors. Lights (visible, non-visible, etc.). Transmitters to transmit sensor data. Receivers to remotely actuate lights or other accessories.<br/>Delivery of the window mountable accessories can be via: Long range dart launched via a mechanical mechanism (i.e., a gun, 12 gauge round from a shotgun, e.g., Remington brand model <b>870</b>, with a reduced charge sufficient to connect the dart to the window without breaking the window). Dart launched by unmanned vehicle <b>10</b> using any sufficient propulsion system, such as spring, pneumatic or the like. Dart placed via immediate proximity by unmanned vehicle <b>10</b>. Accessory mounted by hand.<br />(56) The accessory package <b>108</b> sensors transmit at least one of imagery and sound via a wireless connection to law enforcement. The accessory package <b>108</b> may also be configured to recognize movement and transmit audio alarms to law enforcement.<br />(57) One or more light may be remotely controlled in some configurations. When light(s) are used, it is beneficial for the back side (facing away from the material <b>102</b>) to be black to block light illuminating the opposite direction.<br />(58) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a surveillance device <b>150</b> formed as a dart <b>152</b> having a battery <b>154</b> powering a light source <b>156</b>. The surveillance device <b>150</b> may be attached to a material <b>158</b> via an attachment device <b>160</b> such as a suction cup. In such an embodiment, the light source <b>156</b> of the surveillance device <b>150</b> may be automatically triggered when the dart <b>152</b> is fired from an unmanned aerial vehicle, for instance, such that when the surveillance device <b>150</b> attaches to the material <b>158</b> the light source <b>156</b> shines through the material <b>158</b> to illuminate a building, for instance.<br />(59) In another embodiment illustrated in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a surveillance device <b>200</b> is provided with a portable housing <b>202</b> can be in the form of an unmanned aerial vehicle <b>204</b>. In such an embodiment, an accessory package <b>206</b>, a wireless transceiver, a power supply, and a controller are carried by the portable housing <b>202</b>. In this embodiment, the unmanned aerial vehicle <b>204</b> is designed to be flown to a material <b>208</b> (e.g., a window), and to connect a mounting assembly <b>210</b> (only one of which is marked in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, respectively) to the material <b>208</b> instead of landing. Then, motors on the unmanned aerial vehicle <b>204</b> providing power to propellers are de-actuated so that the unmanned aerial vehicle <b>204</b> body pivots down onto the material <b>208</b> whereby illumination source(s) of the accessory package <b>206</b> can be actuated so that the emission path is directed through the material <b>208</b>, for example.<br />(60) From the above description, it is clear that the inventive concept(s) disclosed herein are well adapted to carry out the objects and to attain the advantages mentioned herein, as well as those inherent in the inventive concept(s) disclosed herein.

As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the lower frame portion <b>22</b> contains the back strap, main spring housing <b>26</b> and the grip, as well as space for the internal firing mechanism. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>, the upper frame portion <b>20</b> houses the barrel <b>34</b>, cylinder <b>60</b> and internal firing mechanism, as described in detail below. A forward end <b>28</b> of the lower frame portion <b>22</b> is shaped so as to accept a corresponding rearward end <b>30</b> of the upper frame portion <b>20</b>. These upper and lower frame portions <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are joined together by pins to create a structurally rigid frame, although any other joining means known in the art may also be used. Importantly, there is no cut-out or accompanying side plate on either the upper or lower frame portions which is normally necessary to access the internal components of the revolver. Instead, due to the modular frame portions and the configuration thereof, the revolver may easily be broken down into its constituent frame parts and the internal components and mechanisms accessed in this manner. The absence of a side cut-out and side plate yields a more symmetrical, and therefore, stronger and more resilient frame.<br />(16) The firearm frame portions are preferably comprised of metal stampings or inserts having a polymer over-molding on top of the inserts. It will be readily appreciated, however, that other metallic and nonmetallic materials may be used in the construction of the frame portions without departing from the scope of the present invention. Indeed, any polymer known in the firearm art may be used to form the upper and lower frame portions provided that sufficient strength and rigidity of the frame components is achieved. The metal inserts can also be varied in material and thickness to achieve a desired strength and rigidity.<br />(17) As alluded to above, known methods of manufacturing firearms, and revolvers in particular, require the precision cutting, milling and fitting of many intricate parts. For example, known firearms require that a slot be cut in the breech face area to accommodate the hand which engages the ratchet on the cylinder to index the cylinder. Indeed, prior art revolvers must be bent and modified to ensure that the barrel, cylinder, firing and locking mechanisms all come into registration within prescribed tolerances so that the revolver operates properly. Importantly, such bending is not required with the polymer frame firearm of the present invention, as known polymer and other molding technologies may be employed to create all of the frame components so as to accommodate the barrel, cylinder, safety and firing mechanism without the need for any additional cutting, milling or modifying.<br />(18) Importantly, the molded polymer frame portions <b>20</b>,<b>22</b> are formed such that they generally define open receptacles preconfigured to receive component subassemblies. As will be readily appreciated, this obviates the need for the frame portions to be milled, cut, and bent to accommodate the individual component parts of the firearm. Instead, various subassemblies, such as the firing mechanism, trigger mechanism and barrel can be preassembled into subassemblies remote from the frame portions and simply “dropped” into the receptacles in the molded polymer frame portions <b>20</b>,<b>22</b> and pinned or otherwise secured in place. As a result of this configuration, the frame portions do not need to be substantially modified after the molding process to accommodate the component parts, thus cutting down on assembly and manufacturing time, as well cost.<br />(19) As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref>, the frame also includes a separate trigger guard <b>32</b> that is releasably attached to the frame via a notch and groove type configuration and which is secured in place by a pin. The fact that the trigger guard <b>32</b> is removable allows a user to customize the accessories that are used with the revolver, such as accessories that may be placed on the forward portion of the trigger guard, e.g., laser sights, etc.<br />(20) Referring now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 3-5</figref>, the barrel <b>34</b> comprises an axially elongated generally cylindrical sleeve which projects forwardly from the upper frame portion <b>20</b> and is received within a barrel shroud <b>36</b>. In one embodiment of the present invention, the barrel <b>34</b> may have a generally cylindrical rifled bore extending coaxially through it, the bore rifling being formed by conventional spiral rifling grooves cut in the wall of the bore, in a manner will known in the firearm and revolver art.<br />(21) A rear portion of the barrel <b>34</b> is externally threaded (not shown) for mating engagement with internal threads (not shown) in a bore on the upper frame portion <b>20</b> of the firearm frame. In a preferred embodiment, the barrel <b>34</b> is threaded at <b>36</b> threads per inch, although different thread sizes and thread counts may be used. There is also a second set of threads <b>38</b> on the distal or muzzle end of the barrel <b>34</b> that are enlarged in diameter and have substantially the same thread count as the rear portion of the barrel <b>34</b>. The barrel <b>34</b> may then be threaded through the shroud <b>36</b> and locked into place. Upon assembly of the firearm <b>10</b>, the cylindrical bore registers with the respective chambers of the cylinder and forms the longitudinal firing axis.<br />(22) The barrel shroud <b>36</b> includes a radially disposed and rearwardly facing abutment surface for complimentary engagement with the forwardly facing seating surface on the forward end of the upper frame portion <b>20</b> of the firearm frame. In one embodiment of the present invention, the upper surface <b>40</b> of the barrel shroud <b>36</b> is substantially flat and is provided with an axially elongated, upwardly open sight receiving groove <b>42</b> formed therein. The groove is adapted to receive a front sight <b>44</b> which is pinned or otherwise secured in fixed position to the shroud member <b>36</b>.<br />(23) The clearance between the forward-most surface of the cylinder and the rearward-most surface of the barrel is referred to as the barrel-cylinder (BC) gap. To set the barrel-cylinder gap, a crush washer <b>110</b> is used, with typical barrel-cylinder gap tolerances being in the range of 4,000ths to 10,000ths of an inch. In particular, to set the barrel-cylinder gap, there are a series of machine flats <b>48</b> provided on the outer circumference of the muzzle end of the barrel <b>34</b> in the approximate position where the front sight <b>44</b> is located. The barrel <b>34</b> is threaded through the shroud <b>36</b> and into the upper frame portion <b>20</b> against the metal frame insert until the threading crushes the metal washer <b>110</b>. Once the predetermined tolerance is reached, the barrel is cocked slightly further so that one of the machine flats <b>48</b> comes to the surface. A pin is then passed through the shroud <b>36</b> and rides across the top of the given flat <b>48</b> on the barrel <b>34</b>, locking the barrel <b>34</b> in place.<br />(24) Other sight configurations, such as a dove-tail sight, may also be used. In this embodiment, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the barrel <b>34</b> is threaded through the shroud <b>36</b> and into the upper frame portion <b>20</b> against the metal frame insert until it crushes the metal washer <b>110</b>. Once the predetermined tolerance is reached, the barrel is cocked slightly further so that one of the machine flats <b>48</b> comes into alignment with the sight receiving groove <b>42</b>. A dove-tail front sight <b>44</b> may be placed into the sight receiving groove <b>42</b> and removably attached to the shroud <b>36</b> via a pin through the shroud <b>36</b> and sight <b>44</b>. The bottom tab <b>50</b> of the sight <b>44</b> is received in the machine flat <b>48</b> and held in place by the pin, locking the barrel <b>34</b> in place.<br />(25) Turning now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 1 and 3-6</figref>, a cylinder <b>60</b> and yoke <b>70</b> are shown. The cylinder <b>60</b> is pivotally mounted in the upper frame portion <b>20</b> and includes an ejector <b>62</b>, a ratchet <b>64</b>, and a plurality of chambers <b>66</b>. The chambers <b>66</b> are configured to receive and align cartridges <b>68</b> with the barrel <b>34</b>. The cylinder <b>60</b> is pivotally mounted on a yoke <b>70</b> that is attached to the frame via a yoke stud. A top strap <b>72</b> extends across a top portion of the frame from a forward portion to a rearward portion to define a generally rectangular aperture <b>74</b>. When the cylinder <b>60</b> is closed with respect to the yoke <b>70</b>, the cylinder <b>60</b> is positioned in the rectangular aperture <b>74</b> such that a chamber <b>66</b> of the cylinder <b>60</b> is longitudinally aligned with the barrel <b>34</b>.<br />(26) As will be readily appreciated, all known revolvers require a retaining mechanism to retain the cylinder within the rectangular aperture <b>74</b>, especially subsequent to firing. In one embodiment of the present invention, the cylinder retaining mechanism comprises an ejector rod <b>76</b> that is spring-biased forward and a ball detent mechanism <b>78</b>. The spring-biased ejector rod <b>76</b> contacts a portion of the frame adjacent the tip of the ejector rod, thereby holding the cylinder in place. To further ensure that the cylinder does not come out of battery during firing, ball detent mechanism <b>78</b> is also provided.<br />(27) The ball detent mechanism includes a vertical pin <b>80</b> with a substantially round head that is received within a corresponding shallow recess <b>82</b> on the underside of upper frame portion <b>20</b>. In the preferred embodiment, vertical pin <b>80</b> is biased by a coil spring, or the functional equivalent thereof, towards shallow recess <b>82</b> when the firearm is in the cylinder-closed position, although no biasing means need be employed. Vertical pin <b>80</b> is mounted in yoke <b>70</b> along an axis that is perpendicular to the bore-axis/firing axis and, importantly, perpendicular to the axis along which the majority of recoil forces are generated. This orientation of the ball detent mechanism <b>78</b> will not allow the yoke <b>70</b> to be released and the cylinder <b>60</b> to be urged open due to recoil forces associated with discharge of the firearm. Vertical pin <b>80</b> also has includes flat <b>84</b> that is in registration with the ejector rod <b>76</b> and is axially movable along an axis perpendicular to the firing axis of the firearm <b>10</b>. Both the spring-biased ejector rod <b>76</b> and the ball detent mechanism <b>78</b> prevent the yoke <b>70</b> from releasing during the firing of the gun. This design is advantageous because it allows for a simpler design and therefore the use of fewer parts than prior art retaining mechanisms.<br />(28) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 7-12</figref> illustrate the drive mechanism of the firearm <b>10</b>. As known in the art, the drive mechanism functions to rotate the cylinder <b>60</b> upon the pulling of the trigger <b>12</b> to place a new cartridge <b>68</b> into alignment with the hammer <b>14</b> and firing pin <b>16</b>. According to one embodiment of the present invention, a complimentary set of star-shaped configurations are used to rotate/index the cylinder <b>60</b>. This star-shaped configuration replaces the commonly-used ratchet mechanism. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref>, the cylinder is provided with a star-shaped socket <b>64</b> on its rearward-facing surface. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref>, a rotatable shaft mounted within the frame and having a complimentary star-shaped hub/head <b>86</b> extends through the breech face area <b>18</b> below the firing pin <b>16</b> and is configured to engage the star-shaped ratchet mechanism <b>64</b> on the cylinder <b>60</b>. It will be readily appreciated, however, that the cylinder may have a male head configuration and the portion of the drive mechanism that extends through the breech face may comprise the corresponding female socket.<br />(29) As best shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, there is internal to the frame a supplemental ratchet surface <b>88</b> on the rearwardly extending portion of the hub/head <b>86</b> whose geometry is such that it is configured to receive on the lower surface a top portion of the newly designed hand <b>90</b>. It is this interior mounted ratchet surface <b>88</b> that receives the hand <b>90</b>. The hand <b>90</b> reciprocates up and down in a vertical fashion, and does not need any lateral forward motion or backward motion to rotate the hub <b>86</b>. Simple vertical reciprocal motion of the hand <b>90</b> upon pressing of the trigger <b>12</b> then causes the pin to be pushed upward to index the cylinder <b>60</b>. The hand <b>90</b> is then is reciprocated downward at the end of the firing stroke.<br />(30) As alluded to above, prior art drive mechanisms necessitated that a slot be cut in the frame in the breech face area to allow the hand to be urged from the interior portion of the gun to a ratcheting mechanism on the center portion of the cylinder to rotate the cylinder. As will be readily appreciated, this hand, ratchet and slot design was costly to manufacture and was very time consuming to align the parts with the needed precision. The present invention therefore benefits from the improved hub/head and interior hand and ratchet mechanism in that no slot need be cut in the breech face area of the frame because the hand does not move laterally out of the interior of the firearm, but instead reciprocates vertically, as described below.<br />(31) With the cylinder indexing mechanism of the present invention, however, there is also a need to disengage the hub <b>86</b> from the cylinder <b>60</b> so that the cylinder <b>60</b> and yoke <b>70</b> can be rotated out of the frame, such as when an operator wishes to eject spent cartridges <b>68</b> and reload. As shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 7, 10, 11 and 12</figref> a latch mechanism <b>92</b> reciprocates the hub <b>86</b> in a direction substantially parallel to the firing axis of the firearm <b>10</b>. This reciprocal movement causes the hub <b>86</b> to be placed into and out of engagement with the star-shaped ratchet mechanism <b>64</b> on the cylinder <b>60</b>. If an operator desires to place the firearm <b>10</b> in the cylinder-open position, the latch <b>92</b> is actuated, which retracts the star-shaped hub <b>86</b> back behind the breach face area <b>18</b> and out of engagement with the star-shaped ratchet <b>86</b> on the cylinder <b>60</b>. This retracted position is best shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 12</figref>. Upon releasing the latch <b>92</b>, the star-shaped hub <b>86</b> extends back through the breech face area <b>18</b> to engage the corresponding star-shaped ratchet mechanism <b>64</b> on the cylinder <b>60</b>.<br />(32) The present invention also contemplates using either or both of a hammer block and a firing pin block as a safety feature to prevent the unintended discharge of the firearm. In the preferred embodiment, there is a firing pin block, as is shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIGS. 9-12</figref>. According to one embodiment of the present invention, the firing pin block comprises a generally cylindrical blocking member <b>94</b> with a flat surface or relieved portion <b>96</b> provided thereon. When the trigger <b>12</b> is in a non-depressed position, the flat surface or relieved portion <b>96</b> on the blocking member <b>94</b> is not in registration with the corresponding relieved portion <b>100</b> on the underside of the firing pin <b>16</b>. As relieved portions <b>100</b>, <b>96</b> of the firing pin and blocking member are not in registration with one another, no clearance is provided for the firing pin, as the full diameter portion of the blocking member <b>94</b> contacts the firing pin <b>96</b>. This prevents the firing pin <b>16</b> from striking a chambered cartridge unless the trigger is pulled, even if the hammer is released due to a faulty components or the pin is struck by another object.<br />(33) When the trigger <b>12</b> is pulled, however, hand <b>90</b> reciprocates up and contacts a lever arm <b>98</b> fixedly attached to blocking member <b>94</b>. As hand <b>90</b> goes through its full stroke, it pushes against lever arm <b>98</b>, causing blocking member <b>94</b> to rotate so that relieved portion <b>96</b> is in registration with relieved portion <b>100</b> on the underside of the firing pin <b>16</b>. When in registration with one another, the relieved portions <b>96</b>, <b>100</b> provide a clearance that allows the firing pin <b>16</b> to release and strike a cartridge. At rest, the pin <b>94</b> is urged back into action such that it comes forward and engages the firing pin <b>16</b>, holding it in place.<br />(34) Although this invention has been shown and described with respect to the detailed embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of skill in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In addition, modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the invention without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the particular embodiments disclosed in the above detailed description, but that the invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of this disclosure."

In particular, the modular firearm F is shown as a bolt-action rifle, and more specifically, a bolt-action sniper rifle. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the various aspects of the invention as described herein are suitable for other types of firearms, including various types of semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms such as handguns, rifles, shotguns, and other long-barreled firearms.<br />[0025] As shown in FIG. 1, the modular firearm F generally includes a frame or chassis 10 including a receiver 20, an interchangeable barrel assembly 100 mounted to the receiver 20 at a front end 12 of the chassis 10 and defining a chamber 30 at a position where the barrel assembly 100 connects to the receiver 20, a magazine well 40 defined in the chassis 10 and in communication with the chamber 30, and a foldable butt stock assembly 400 mounted to a rear end 14 of the chassis 10. A pistol-style handgrip 50 can be connected to the chassis 10 adjacent the rear end 14 of the chassis 10, and a modular hand guard assembly 500 can be located along the front portion of the chassis 10 to assist in gripping and holding the firearm F. An interchangeable bolt assembly 200 generally is slidably received in the receiver 20 for operation of the firearm F. A fire control 60 is mounted to the chassis 10 for controlling firing of the firearm F. Additionally, ammunition magazine 300 will be received in the magazine well 40 for supplying ammunition to the receiver 20.<br />[0026] Still referring to FIG. 1, the receiver 20 generally will be constructed of a high strength, durable, but lightweight material, typically a metal or metal alloy such as a titanium alloy. Referring to FIG. 2, a barrel engagement portion 22 of the receiver 20 can be constructed of the same material as the remainder of the receiver 20, or the barrel engagement portion 22 can be constructed of a different, durable, high strength material. For example, the barrel engagement portion 22 can be constructed of steel, thereby providing a steel-on-steel lockup arrangement between the barrel engagement portion of the receiver and the barrel extension 120 (FIGS. 2 and 3) when the barrel extension 120 is also constructed of steel. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the receiver 20 includes a breech 24 through which casings from spent ammunition cartridges may be ejected from the firearm F.<br />[0027] Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the fire control 60 is provided for actuating/firing the firearm F and includes a trigger 62 as part of a trigger assembly housed in the chassis 10. The fire control 60 is operably connected to the firing pin 260 such that actuation of the trigger 62 operates a firing pin 262 (FIG. 2) to fire the firearm F. The fire control 60 can include an adjustable fire control system such as a Remington Arms Company, Inc. X Mark Pro fire control system, which generally is adjustable to enable variable pressure/trigger pulls, for example, from about 2.4 to about 4.5 pounds of pressure for actuation of the trigger assembly, although more or even less pressure also can be used as understood in the art.<br />[0028] As shown in FIG. 3, the barrel assembly 100 includes a barrel 110 and a barrel extension 120 for mounting the barrel 110 to the receiver 20. The barrel 110 and barrel extension 120 define a central axial bore 102 and can be integrally formed so as to define a substantially unitary, single piece barrel assembly, or can be separately formed and adapted to connect together as a multi-piece barrel assembly. The forward or distal end 122 of the barrel extension 120 can be attached to a rear end 114 of the barrel by a threaded connection or adhesive bond, for example. A rear end 124 of the barrel extension 120 can be attached to the barrel engagement portion 22 of the receiver 20 at the front end 12 of the chassis 10 in a known manner. A locking aperture 126 for interfacing with the bolt assembly 200 is formed at the rear end 124 of the barrel extension 120 in alignment with the central axial bore 102. The locking aperture 126 includes a central aperture or bore 127 that communicates with the bore 102 of the barrel, and a plurality of recess portions 128 projecting radially outwardly from and spaced about the central aperture or bore 127 of the barrel.<br />[0029] Referring to FIGS. 2, 4 and 5, the bolt assembly 200 of the firearm F generally includes a substantially hollow bolt body 210, an interchangeable bolt head 230 that can be configured to fit ammunition cartridges of a specific caliber, a bolt plug 250, and a firing pin assembly 160. The bolt body 210 typically includes a bolt handle 214 that can be grasped for sliding the bolt body 210 within the receiver 20, an axial bore 216 longitudinally extending from a rear or distal end 212 to a front or proximal end 211, and a transverse locking bore 213 located adjacent the front end 212 of the bolt body as indicated in FIG. 4. The bolt body 210 further generally includes a bolt guide channel 217 formed in an exterior surface of the bolt body 210. The bolt guide channel 217 includes a transversely extending channel segment 218 located near the rear end 212 of the bolt body 210, and an axially extending channel segment 219 extending from the transversely extending segment 218 towards the front end 211 of the bolt body 210. The bolt guide channel is adapted to be engaged by a guide member or rail within the receiver for guiding the bolt assembly during a loading and cocking operation of the firearm.<br />[0030] As illustrated in FIGS. 4 and 5, the bolt head 230 includes a front or proximal end 231 configured to engage an ammunition cartridge as shown in FIG. 2, a rear or distal end 232 configured to be received in and attached to the bolt body 210, and radially projecting locking lugs 234 (FIG. 5) located along the side wall of the bolt body adjacent the front end 231. The locking lugs 234 are configured to selectively engage the locking aperture 126 (FIG. 2) of the barrel extension 120 for securing the bolt head 230 in place during firing of the firearm F, as will be described later. As shown in FIGS. 4-5, the bolt head 230 further includes an axially extending firing pin bore 235 that aligns with the tip portion 268 of the firing pin 262 of the firearm, a transverse bolt head locking bore 236, an axially extending extractor mounting channel 237, aligned transverse pivot pin bores 238 intersecting the extractor mounting channel 237, an axially extending ejector mounting bore 239, and a transverse ejector locking channel 240.<br />[0031] Referring again to FIG. 4, the bolt head 230 is releasably mountable to the front end 211 of the bolt body 210 by engagement of a locking pin 247 that is insertable in the transverse bolt head locking bores 213, 236 to enable removal and/or change-out of the bolt face as needed to change the caliber of the firearm and enable firing of different types/calibers of ammunition. The locking pin 247 further can be configured so as to include an axial bore 248 for receiving a tip portion 268 of a firing pin 262 therethrough so as to enable the bolt face change-out without interfering with or requiring change-out of the firing pin as well.<br />[0032] Referring to FIG. 5, one or more extractors 241 can be pivotally mounted in one or more extractor mounting channels 237 (only one shown) by engagement with a pivot pin 243 inserted through the transverse pivot pin bores 238. A biasing spring 242 can be inserted in the extractor mounting channel 237 between the bolt head 230 and the extractor 241 to pivotally bias the extractor 241 toward an engaging position for engaging and holding the ammunition cartridge for extraction upon operation of the bolt assembly after firing. As further indicated in FIG. 5, an ejector 244 can be mounted in the ejector mounting bore 239 with a locking pin 245 inserted through an ejector locking channel 240 for releasably securing the ejector. An ejector spring 246 generally coaxially positioned with the ejector 244 along the ejector mounting bore 239, so as to bias the ejector forwardly and control axial movement during extraction and ejection of the spent cartridge by the ejector 244 of the bolt head.<br />[0033] As illustrated in FIG. 4, the bolt plug 250 is generally hollow so as to define an axial bore 256 therethrough, and includes a front portion 252 insertable in the rear end 212 of the bolt body 210, a rear portion 254, and an axial bore 256 extending from the front portion 252 to the rear portion 254 for receiving the firing pin assembly 260. The rear portion 254 of the bolt plug 250 is configured to abut the rear end 212 of the bolt body 210 and thereby limit the depth of insertion of the front portion 252 in the bolt body 210.<br />[0034] Still referring to FIG. 4, the firing pin assembly 260 includes the firing pin 262, which includes a head portion 264 mountable within the axial bore 256 of the bolt plug 250, a body portion 266 insertable in the axial bore and mountable to the head portion 264, and a tip portion 268, which projects forwardly from the body portion 264 so as to extend through the bore 235 of the bolt head assembly for engaging and firing a round of ammunition or cartridge within the chamber of the firearm. The firing pin assembly 260 further generally includes a recoil spring 269 mountable around the body portion 266.<br />[0035] When the bolt assembly 200 is assembled as shown in FIG. 2, the bolt head 230 is connected to the front end 211 of the bolt body 210, the firing pin assembly 260 is connected to the bolt plug 250, and the bolt plug 250 and firing pin assembly 260 are inserted into the bolt body 210. Specifically, the rear end 212 of the bolt head 210 is inserted into the axial hole 216 in the bolt body 210 through the front end 211 of the bolt body 102, and the transverse locking bore 236 in the bolt head 230 is aligned with the transverse locking bores 213 in the bolt body 210, and the locking pin 247 is inserted through the locking bores 213, 236, thereby securing the bolt head 230 to the bolt body 210. The firing pin assembly 260 is mounted to the bolt plug 250 such that the firing pin 262 is inserted through the axial bore 256 of the bolt plug 250, the head portion 264 of the firing pin is attached to the bolt plug 250, the body and tip portions 266, 268 of the firing pin extend from the front portion 252 of the bolt plug 250, and the recoil spring 269 is positioned around the body portion 266 of the firing pin. The body and tip portions 266, 268 of the firing pin 262 and the front portion 252 of the bolt plug 250 are inserted into the bolt body 210 such that the tip portion 268 of the firing pin 262 is aligned with and can be actuated to extend through the axial firing pin bore 235 and the axial bore 248 in the locking pin 247. The rear portion 254 of the bolt plug 250 further typically is secured to the rear end 212 of the bolt body 210 to complete the bolt assembly 200.<br />[0036] According to one example embodiment, the length of the bolt assembly 200 can allow feeding and ejection of various length ammunition cartridges up to 4.2'' long, although various other larger or smaller size and/or caliber cartridges also can be used. If it is desired to change the caliber of ammunition used with the firearm F, the bolt assembly 200 can easily be removed from the firearm F, and the bolt head 230 can be disconnected from the bolt assembly 200 by removing the locking pin 247 from the transverse locking bores 213 and 236. With the locking pin removed, the bolt head 230 can be disengaged from the bolt body 102. The bolt head 230 can then be replaced in the bolt assembly 200 with a replacement bolt head of the desired ammunition caliber, and the bolt assembly including the replacement bolt head can be reinstalled in the firearm F. Additionally, the barrel 110 (FIG. 3), which defines a chamber of a first ammunition caliber, also generally will be disengaged from the receiver of the firearm and a new, second barrel defining a chamber configured to receive ammunition cartridges of a second, different caliber or size can be installed in its place to facilitate firing of a new, different caliber or type of ammunition. Together with various size ammunition magazines, or a reconfigurable magazine as noted below, the interchangeable barrel and bolt assembly can define a simple and different caliber conversion system or assembly for the firearm.<br />[0037] As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, when the firearm F is in a normal operational condition for firing a round of ammunition, the bolt assembly 200 is slidably mounted in the receiver 20 for chambering and ejecting ammunition. A bolt stop lever 80 is pivotally mounted to the receiver 20. The bolt stop lever 80 is located at a central, upper, rear region of the receiver 20, and includes an external grip portion 82 and a guide arm 84 extending from the grip portion 82. The grip portion 82 is exposed on the external surface of the firearm F at the central, upper, rear region of the receiver 20, and is operable by a user's finger or thumb at the exterior of the firearm F to pivot the bolt stop lever 80 in directions U1, U2. The guide arm 84 selectively registers with the guide channel 217 (FIG. 4) extending along the bolt body 210 based on the pivotal position of the bolt stop lever 80. The bolt stop lever 80 may be biased in the direction U2 by a biasing member, such as a spring 86, to protect against accidental disengagement of the bolt stop lever with the guide channel 217. As FIG. 2 indicates, the bolt stop lever cooperates with a transverse channel segment 218 of the channel 217 (FIG. 4) in the bolt body 210 to guide forward and rearward linear movement of the bolt assembly 200 in the directions L1, L2, guide rotation of the bolt assembly 200 about its central axis in the directions T1, T2 and selectively stop or limit travel of the bolt assembly 200 in the rearward direction L2. Thus, the channel 217 and the lever 80 together form a bolt stop and guide mechanism. As FIG. 2 indicates, the engagement of the lugs 234 with locking aperture 126 helps to limit rearward linear movement of the bolt assembly 200 in the direction L2, so as to assist in selectively stopping or limiting travel of the bolt assembly 200 in the rearward direction L2.<br />[0038] In operation of the bolt assembly 200 and the bolt stop lever, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 6, the bolt assembly 200 generally is disposed in a forwardmost, position in the receiver and rotated in the direction T1 about its central axis with the bolt handle 104 turned to and its downwardmost position, when in an operating condition. The bolt head 230 extends through the locking aperture 126 in the barrel extension 120 and is oriented such that the locking lugs 234 are out of alignment with the outer aperture portions 129 of the locking aperture 126, thereby locking the bolt head 230 in the barrel extension 120. The bolt stop lever 80 is in its downwardmost position in the direction U1 such that the guide arm 84 is in registry with the transverse channel segment 218 of the channel 217 in the bolt body 210. With the bolt assembly 200 and the bolt stop lever 80 in this configuration, the bolt assembly 200 is restricted from moving in the directions L1, L2 and the firearm F is configured for firing a round of ammunition C1 from the chamber 30.<br />[0039] In order to eject a round of ammunition C1 (FIG. 2) or a casing of a spent round of ammunition C1 from the magazine well 40 into the receiver 20, the bolt assembly 200 can be rotated in the upward in the direction U2 and moved rearward in the direction L2. Specifically, the bolt assembly 200 can be rotated in the upward in the direction U2 such that the guide arm 84 is in registry with the axial channel segment 219 and the bolt handle 214 is in its upwardmost position. With the bolt assembly 200 in this position, the locking lugs 234 of the bolt head 230 are aligned with the outer aperture portions 129 of the locking aperture 126. After rotating the bolt assembly 200 in the direction U2 as described, the bolt assembly 200 can be moved rearwardly in the direction L2 to its rearwardmost position such that the bolt head 230 passes out of the locking aperture 126.<br />[0040] During rearward movement of the bolt assembly 200, the extractor 241 (FIG. 5) will grab the casing/ammunition round C1 and the ejector 244 will eject the casing/ammunition round C1 from the breech 24 (FIG. 2). The bolt assembly 200 is restricted from rotating during its rearward movement. When the bolt assembly 200 is in its rearwardmost position, the guide arm 84 remains in registry with the channel segment 219, engaging a front edge of the channel segment 219 to prevent the bolt assembly 200 from being inadvertently removed from the receiver 200. If it is desired to remove the bolt assembly 300 from the receiver (to replace the bolt head 110, for example), the bolt stop 80 may be pivoted downward in the direction U1 to deregister the guide arm 84 and disengage the locking lugs from the locking aperture, thereby allowing the bolt assembly 200 to slide rearwardly out of the receiver 20.<br />[0041] As indicated in FIGS. 2 and 6, after ejecting a spent cartridge or round, the bolt assembly 200 may be moved forward in the direction L1 from its rearwardmost position in order to advance a next or new ammunition cartridge C1 from the ammunition magazine 300 to the chamber. During such forward movement, the guide channel segment 119 engages the guide arm 84 such that the bolt assembly 200 cannot rotate in the directions T1, T2 until the bolt assembly reaches its forwardmost position in the receiver. The bolt assembly 200 then can be turned downwardly in the direction T1 to lock the bolt assembly 200 in position for firing the round of ammunition C1, as described above.<br />[0042] As perhaps best shown in FIG. 6, the location of the bolt stop lever 80 enables ambidextrous operation of the bolt stop lever 80. Additionally, with the bolt stop lever 80 positioned centrally on an upper rear surface of the receiver 20, the bolt stop lever 80 is naturally shielded by a top rail 540 (described in detail later) and potentially by a scope or other aiming optics (not shown) or accessories that may be mounted on the top rail 540. Inadvertent operation of the bolt stop/guide lever 80 can therefore be prevented without the requirement of additional fencing material or a cover.<br />[0043] Referring to FIGS. 2, 7 and 8, a magazine 300 generally will be received within the magazine well 40. In one embodiment, the magazine 300 can be a modular, interchangeable magazine including a magazine box or magazine body 302, as shown in FIGS. 7-8 and having a removable bottom plate 307, and a magazine follower assembly 310 disposed in the magazine body 302 for advancing ammunition cartridges towards the top of the magazine body 302. As indicated in FIG. 7, the bottom plate 307 of such a magazine can be removed from the magazine body 302 to enable repair or replacement/reconfiguration of parts by sliding the bottom plate forward in the direction L1 off of the magazine body 302. Conversely, the bottom plate 307 can be reconnected to the magazine body 302 by sliding the bottom plate rearwardly in the direction L2 onto the magazine body 302.<br />[0044] As an example, the magazine 300 can be a center feed, double stack type magazine capable of feeding ammunition from 1-2 stacked, parallel rows or groups as indicated in FIGS. 2 and 7-8. A spring-loaded magazine release button 304 (FIGS. 6 and 9) can be provided on a rear wall 303 of the magazine body 302 for selectively locking the magazine 300 in the magazine well 40 and releasing the magazine 300 from the magazine well 40. Specifically, when the magazine 300 is inserted in the magazine well 40, the spring-loaded release button 304 is biased into engagement with a locking aperture 42, which is positioned in a rear wall of the magazine well 40, adjacent the receiver 20 and above a trigger guard 66 of the firearm F. The spring-loaded release button 304 can be depressed to disengage the locking aperture 42 and allow the magazine 300 to be removed from the magazine well 40.<br />[0045] In another embodiment, the magazine 300 can be adjustable so as to be reconfigurable to accommodate cartridges of different lengths, sizes, and/or different calibers of ammunition within a specific caliber by way of a removable/interchangeable spacer 320 that is insertable in the magazine body 302 at a front end 305 thereof. As illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8, the magazine 300 generally can be configured to accommodate standard length ammunition cartridges C1 when the spacer 320 is installed in the magazine body 302. A cutout or channel 322 (FIG. 8) is provided in the spacer 320 and is configured to receive and retain front ends of the cartridges C1. The spacer 320 is configured to extend substantially from a top 306 to the bottom plate 307 of the magazine body 302. As perhaps best shown in FIG. 7, the spacer 320 can include resilient detent members 324 configured to lock the spacer 310 within the magazine body 302 by engaging locking channels 309 in side walls 308 of the magazine body 302. The spacer 320 can be connected to the magazine body 302 by removing the bottom plate 307 and inserting the spacer upwardly into the magazine body in the direction H1 until the detent members 324 lockingly engage the locking channels 309.<br />[0046] As indicated in FIGS. 2 and 8, the magazine 300 can be configured to accommodate longer, non-standard length ammunition cartridges C2 when the spacer 320 is removed from the magazine body 302. As FIG. 8 illustrates, the spacer 320 can be removed from the magazine body 302 by depressing the detent members 324 until the detent members 324 disengage the locking channels 307, and then moving the spacer 320 downward in the direction H2, out of the magazine body 302.<br />[0047] It is further envisioned that the spacer 320 can be interchanged with other spacers of different configurations to accommodate other ammunition cartridges of various lengths/sizes and/or calibers. Additionally, the magazine 300 may be interchanged with other magazines configured to accommodate ammunition cartridges of different calibers and/or lengths. For example, as shown in FIGS. 9-10, the receiver 20 can include a conversion block mounting bore 44 adjacent the magazine well 40 for mounting a magazine conversion block 350 in the magazine well 40. The magazine conversion block 350 can be, for example, a 7.62 mm NATO conversion block that enables smaller 7.62 mm NATO ammunition magazines to be inserted in the magazine well 40. Referencing FIG. 10, the magazine conversion block 350 includes a cradle portion 351 for receiving an ammunition magazine (not shown) that is smaller than the magazine 300 described above. As illustrated in FIGS. 9 and 10, the magazine conversion block 350 includes catch assembly 354 including a release arm 356 that is biased rearward in the direction L2 by a pivotable biasing arm 358. The biasing arm 358 is biased rearward against the release arm 356 by a torsional spring 359. The magazine conversion block 350 also has a central mounting bore 360 configured for alignment with the conversion block mounting bore 44.<br />[0048] As can be understood from FIGS. 9 and 10, the magazine conversion block 350 can be installed in the magazine well 40 by sliding the conversion block 350 upward in the direction H1 until the release arm of the magazine release button 304 (FIG. 9) snaps into the locking aperture 42 above the trigger guard 66 and the central mounting bore 360 is aligned with the conversion block mounting bore 44. A fastener 362, such as a bolt or screw, can then be inserted into the bores 360, 44 to secure the magazine conversion block 350 in place. The magazine conversion block 350 can be uninstalled from the magazine well 40 by removing the fastener 362, pressing the release arm 356 forward in the direction L1 against the bias of the biasing arm 358 until the release arm 356 disengages the locking aperture 42, and then sliding the magazine conversion block 350 downward in the direction H2 out of the magazine well 40.<br />[0049] It can be understood from the above disclosure that, due to the reconfigurability of the barrel assembly 100 and the bolt assembly 200, the firearm F can be modified to operate with ammunition of multiple calibers by changing or reconfiguring only the barrel 100, bolt head 230, and the magazine 300 if needed. According to one example, the barrel assembly 100, bolt head 230 and magazine 300 may be packaged together as a caliber conversion assembly or kit configured for operation with ammunition of a specific caliber. Due to the modular designs of the barrel assembly 100, the bolt assembly 200 and the magazine 300, the barrel assembly 100, bolt head 230 and magazine 300 can easily and quickly be installed in and uninstalled from the firearm F to replace and be replaced by respective barrel assemblies, bolt heads and magazines as needed for accommodating operation of the firearm with ammunition of other, different calibers and/or sizes. For example, the firearm F can be convertible to operate with ammunition calibers including, but not limited to, 338 Lapua Magnum and 300 Winchester Magnum. Furthermore, with the use of the magazine conversion block 350, operation of the firearm F with 7.62 mm NATO ammunition is possible. It should be understood that, due to the modular design of the barrel assembly 100, bolt assembly 200, the firearm F also can be configured to be convertible to operate with ammunition calibers other than those specifically discussed.<br />[0050] FIGS. 1 and 11A show the firearm F in a shooting configuration with the foldable butt stock assembly 400 in an extended position, in line with the chassis 10. As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 11A-11C, the butt stock assembly 400 includes a butt stock 410 having a body or frame 405, and a hinge member 430 connected to a front end 411 of the butt stock 410. The hinge member 430 is pivotally connected to hinge bracket 28 at the rear or distal end 14 of the chassis by a hinge pin 432. A threaded member such as a screw 434 can extend transversely to and bear against the hinge pin or bolt 432 within the hinge member 430 to reduce slack or spacing in the connection between the hinge member 430 and the hinge bracket 28, and further helps prevent the hinge pin 432 from separating from the chassis system. The axial position of the screw 434 in the directions L1, L2 can be adjusted to vary the degree to which the screw 434 bears against the hinge pin 432, and thereby adjust the amount of slack in the connection between the hinge member 430 and the hinge bracket 28. The butt stock 410 includes a bolt handle window or opening 412 for receiving the bolt handle 214 when the stock is in the folded (or retracted) configuration (FIGS. 11C-12).<br />[0051] An adjustable butt plate 414 further generally is connected to a rear end of the stock body or frame 405. The butt plate 414 can be vertically adjustable upwardly and downwardly in the directions H1 and H2 by an adjustment feature or member 422 adjacent a lower or bottom portion of the butt plate and pad 414. The length of pull of the butt plate is adjustable, as indicated by arrows L1-L2 in FIG. 1, by engagement/rotation of a first adjustment knob or wheel 416. An adjustable cheek piece or comb 418, typically formed from a resilient cushioning material, also can be connected to the stock body 405, extending upwardly from the butt stock 410, and is adjustable in a vertical direction with respect to the firearm F via a second adjustment knob or wheel 420. As a result, the comb or cheek piece 418 can be adjusted in the direction of arrows H1-H2 to fit a user's preference or comfort. The cheek piece further can be adjusted in the longitudinal direction (indicated by arrows L1-L2) by disengaging fasteners securing the check piece, adjusting it forwardly or rearwardly as desired, and thereafter resecuring the cheek piece with the fasteners. Additionally the length of pull of the butt stock assembly 400 can be adjustable via the addition and removal of spacers, that are insertable between the butt stock body 405 and the butt plate 414. According to an exemplary embodiment, the length of pull may be adjustable between about 12.4 inches and about 14.4 inches.<br />[0052] FIGS. 11A-11C illustrate a latch mechanism 440 for the foldable butt stock assembly 400, which is operable to selectively enable pivoting of the butt stock assembly 400 between an extended configuration (FIGS. 1 and 11A) and a folded configuration (FIGS. 11C and 12). In the extended position, the butt stock assembly 400 extends rearwardly from the rear end 14 of the chassis 10, in line with the chassis 10 (FIGS. 1 and 11A), enabling the firearm to be operated. In the folded configuration, the butt stock assembly 400 extends forwardly from the rear end 14 of the chassis 10, substantially parallel to the chassis 10, and is secured to a lateral side of the chassis 10, thereby reducing the length of the firearm F to facilitate transporting the firearm.<br />[0053] As shown in FIGS. 11A-11B, the latch mechanism 440 generally includes a substantially L-shaped, pivotable latch arm 442 having a first arm portion 444 extending transversely to the longitudinal axis X of the firearm F/butt stock assembly 400, a second arm portion 446 extending from the first arm portion 444 in a direction substantially perpendicular thereto along the axis X, and a pivot pin 448 provided at a junction of the first and second arm portions 444, 446. A detent element or boss 450 is connected to a free end of the second arm portion 446 and extends substantially perpendicular thereto. The first arm portion 444 is partially housed within the hinge member 430 and has a free end protruding from a side of the hinge member 430 and terminating at a tab 445. The second arm portion 446 extends within the hinge member 430. The boss 450 is disposed within a transverse bore 452 in the hinge member 430 and is selectively received within a locking opening pocket 453 mounted to the hinge member 430 and positioned laterally opposite the hinge pin 432. A biasing spring 454 located within the bore 452 biases the boss 450 in the lateral direction indicated by the arrow Z1. When the butt stock assembly 400 is in the extended position shown in FIGS. 1 and 11A, the locking pocket 46 is aligned with the transverse bore 452 and the boss 450 is retained in a locking opening or pocket 453 under the biasing force of the spring 454. Thus, the boss 450 locks the butt stock assembly 400 and the chassis 10 together such that the butt stock assembly 400 cannot be pivoted with respect to the chassis 10.<br />[0054] FIGS. 11B-12 illustrate a process for pivoting the butt stock assembly 400 from the extended configuration of FIGS. 1 and 11A to the folded configuration of FIGS. 11C-12. As shown in FIG. 11A, the butt stock assembly 400 can be unlocked from the chassis 10 by moving the tab 445 in the rearward direction of the firearm as indicated by the arrow L2 which causes the latch arm 442 to pivot clockwise about the pivot pin 448, in the direction indicated by the arrow P1. As a result, the boss 450 is moved against the biasing force of the spring 454 in the lateral direction indicated by the arrow Z2, and is removed from the locking pocket 453, thereby unlocking the butt stock assembly 400 from the chassis 10. Thereafter, as shown in FIGS. 11B-11C, the butt stock assembly 400 can be pivoted counterclockwise about the hinge pin 432, in the direction indicated by the arrow P2 at the hinge 432. Once the butt stock 200 is pivoted in the direction P2 to a point at which the boss 450 is out of alignment with the locking pocket 453, the tab 445 may be released, causing the boss to be moved in the direction Z1 under the biasing force of the spring 454, and thereby causing the lever arm 442 to be pivoted counterclockwise in the direction P2 under the biasing force of the spring 454. The butt stock 400 then may be pivoted until the butt stock is positioned adjacent the chassis 10 and extends substantially parallel thereto (FIG. 12).<br />[0055] When the butt stock assembly 400 is positioned in this folded configuration or manner, the tab 445 lockingly engages a locking feature located on the sidewall of the chassis 10 adjacent the butt stock assembly 400, shown in FIG. 11C as including, for example, a locking plate 70, thereby securing the butt stock assembly 400 in the folded position. Specifically, the tab 445 lockingly engages an edge 73 of an opening 72 in the locking plate 70 or other, similar locking feature as will be understood by those skilled in the art. As shown in FIGS. 11C and 12, when the butt stock assembly 400 is secured in the folded position, the bolt handle 214 extends through and is retained within the bolt handle opening 412, thereby preventing movement and operation of the bolt assembly 200. Additionally, when the butt stock assembly 400 is in its folded position, the boss 450 protrudes from the firearm F through the transverse bore 452, as indicated in FIG. 12. The tab 445 can be released from locking engagement with the edge 73 of the locking plate 70 by pressing the boss 450 against the biasing force of the spring 454 in the direction indicated by the arrow Z2, which causes the latch arm 442 to pivot clockwise in the as indicated by the arrow P1. Thereafter, the butt stock assembly 400 can be pivoted clockwise about the hinge pin 432 in the direction P1 and the boss 450 can be released and allowed to move in the direction Z1 under the biasing force of the spring 454. The butt stock assembly 400 can then be pivoted in the direction P1 until the butt stock assembly 400 is secured in its extended position, as described above with respect to FIGS. 1 and 11A.<br />[0056] As indicated in FIGS. 11A-11B, the locking opening or pocket 453 retains the boss 450 until the force of the spring 454 is overcome by rotation of the butt stock assembly, and generally is aligned with the boss 450 when the stock is in its extended position. The position and/or alignment of the pocket 453 further can be adjusted as needed to accommodate changes in the butt stock assembly. As indicated in FIGS. 11A-11C, a locking set screw or similar locking member 460 can be located just above the locking opening or pocket 453 to secure the position thereof with respect to the boss 450 when the butt stock assembly is in its extended position. When this set screw is loosened, 453 can be rotated and thereby taking the &quot;slop&quot; or variance out of the union between the lower stock assembly and the buttstock assembly. The receiving bore of the locking pocket 453 also is generally eccentrically shaped, and rotating the pocket, which thus rotates the receiving bore with respect to the boss 450, tightens up the interaction between the receiving bore of the locking pocket 453 and the boss 450 to help ensure secure and constant engagement of the boss 450 within the receiving bore of the locking pocket 453 to lock the stock in its extended position. Once the desired adjustment of the locking pocket is made, the set screw 460 can be tightened to secure or fix the locking pocket 453 in place.<br />[0057] FIGS. 1 and 13-15 show features of the hand guard assembly 500. As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, the hand guard assembly 500 includes a substantially tubular hand guard 510 defining a plurality of rail mounting platforms and a substantially tubular hand guard connector 530 for connecting the hand guard 510 to the front end 12 of the chassis 10. According to the exemplary embodiment illustrated herein, the hand guard 510 defines eight rail mounting platforms including a top platform 512, side platforms 514, 516, 518, a bottom platform 520, and side platforms 522, 524, 526, with each platform being disposed in a separate plane. Accordingly, the hand guard 510 has an octagonal cross-sectional shape in a plane transverse to the longitudinal axis of the hand guard assembly 500. Each platform 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526 includes a plurality of longitudinally spaced vent holes or openings 502 for venting heat from the barrel 110, and a plurality of longitudinally spaced mounting holes 504 for connecting accessory mounting rails 560, 580 to the hand guard 510. In the embodiment shown, the vent holes 502 are substantially oval in shape, and are positioned along the length of the hand guard 510 in alternating arrangement with the mounting holes 504. However, one skilled in the art will understand that other configurations of vent holes and mounting holes are possible.<br />[0058] As shown in FIGS. 13 and 15, the hand guard connector 530 can be formed integrally with or connected to a rear end of the platforms 512, 314, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, and includes a flange 532 for connecting the hand guard 510 to the chassis 10. The flange 532 is formed at a lower portion of the hand guard connector 530, and the hand guard connector 532 can be connected to a lower portion of the front end 12 of the chassis 10 with fasteners, such as bolts or screws 534, inserted through the flange 532.<br />[0059] As also shown in FIGS. 13 and 15, a top accessory mounting rail 540 for mounting accessories to the firearm F is provided on the top platform 512 (at the 12 o'clock position) of the hand guard 510. The top rail 540 can be adjustable and can be a replaceable Mil. Std. 1913 rail, for example. Referring to FIG. 22, the top rail 540 includes a top surface 544 for interfacing with an accessory (not shown) such as a scope or other optic device, a bottom surface 546 for interfacing with the top platform 512. A plurality of mounting holes 548 extend through the top and bottom surfaces 544, 546 for mounting the top rail 540 to the top platform 512. At least one recoil absorbing lug 549 extends from the bottom surface 546 of the top rail 540 at a rear section thereof. Each recoil absorbing lug 549 can be integrally formed with the bottom surface of the top rail 540 or with an associated platform of the hand guard assembly, or can be separately insertable into or engageable with the top rail and/or an associated platform. As shown in FIG. 19, the top rail 540 can be secured to the hand guard 510 by aligning mounting holes 548 with corresponding mounting holes 504 in the top platform 512 and corresponding mounting bores 90 (shown in FIG. 2) in the receiver 20, aligning each and inserting fasteners such as threaded fasteners 550 through aligned mounting holes 548, 504 and aligned mounting holes and bores 548, 90. The recoil absorbing lug can engage a recess in the top of the receiver 20, for seating the lug and helping secure the accessory mounting rail to the receiver. The rail 540 further can be a substantially continuous long rail so as to ensure that all optics and/or accessories mounted on the top rail are planarly aligned.<br />[0060] Each of the remaining platforms 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526 may have one or more accessory mounting rails, such accessory mounting rails 360, 380, connected thereto for mounting accessories on the firearm F. The rails 360, 380 and any other mounting rails connected to the platforms 512, 314, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526 can also be Mil. Std. 1913 rail sections. The rails 360, 380 may be constructed to be shorter in length than the platforms as shown, or they may be constructed to extend substantially the entire length of the platforms 512, 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526.<br />[0061] Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, the rails 560, 580 each include a top surface 564, 584 for interfacing with an accessory, a bottom surface 566, 580 for interfacing with one of the platforms 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, a plurality of mounting holes 568, 588, and one or more recoil absorbing lugs 590 received within the Mounting holes 588 formed in the rail surfaces. The Mounting holes 568, 588 are configured to be aligned with corresponding mounting holes 504 in one of the platforms 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526. The recoil absorbing lugs 569, 589 also can be formed integrally with the bottom surfaces 566, 586 or the rails or can be inserted into the rail and platform(s) of the hand guard assembly. The recoil absorbing lugs 569 of the rail 560 are spaced such that they are configured to engage a rear edge 502a and a front edge 502b of the same vent hole 502. The recoil absorbing lugs 569 of the rail 560 are spaced such that they are configured to engage a rear edge 502a of one vent hole 502 and a front edge 502b of another vent hole 502.<br />[0062] Thus, a rail section 360 or 380 can be secured to the hand guard 510 by inserting the pair of lugs 569 or 589 in one or more vent holes, and/or by aligning each mounting hole 568 or 588 with a corresponding mounting hole 504, and inserting fasteners such as threaded fasteners 570 through aligned mounting holes 568 and 504 or aligned mounting holes 588 and 504.<br />[0063] By way of example, a scope (not shown) or other optic can be attached to the top rail 540 and/or a bipod (not shown) can be attached to a bottom rail section 350. However, because each platform 514, 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526 is positioned in its own plane and includes a plurality of mounting holes 502, rails of different sizes and/or configurations can be mounted at various positions and in various configurations and numbers along the length of each platform, thereby enabling various types and combinations of accessories to be mounted on the hand guard 510. Furthermore, it should be understood that the accessory mounting rails 560, 580 can be mounted on other surfaces of the firearm F, such as, but not limited to the butt stock 410 (FIG. 1).<br />[0064] Due to the manner in which the hand guard assembly 500 is connected to the chassis 10/receiver 20, the hand guard assembly 500 surrounds the barrel 110, but is not directly connected to the barrel 110. Because the hand guard assembly 500 is not directly connected to the barrel 110, the hand guard 510 is substantially free-floating with respect to the barrel, thereby improving accuracy in operating the firearm F. The recoil absorbing lugs 549, 569, 589 absorb recoil forces generated by firing the firearm F and thereby resist shearing of accessories mounted on respective rails 540, 560, 580.<br />[0065] In addition, radially located sling swivel cups, such as indicated at 700 in FIG. 13, can be attached adjacent the fore-end and the butt stock of the firearm F. There typically can be four sling swivel cups, although more or fewer sling swivel cups also can be used. One to three of these sling swivel cups can be used to attach carrying slings to the weapon via a push-fit sling swivel. The chassis 10 and the buttstock body 400 also can include one or more of such sling swivel cups for attaching an opposite end of the carrying sling thereto.<br />[0066] Certain electronic accessories, such as optics, which can be attached to the firearm F by mounting on the hand guard 510 or other parts of the firearm F, often require wire or cable connections in or on the firearm. Thus, as illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 15, the firearm F can include a wire management system 600 including one or more wire channels 602 integrated in exterior walls of the chassis 10, the hand guard 510, and/or the hand guard connector 530. One or more wires or cables 604 can be placed in the channel(s) 600 and routed to components and/or accessories in and/or on the firearm F. The wire(s) 604 can be secured in the channel(s) 600 by retaining clips 610 inserted into openings 601 the channel(s) 600. Each retaining clip 610 (FIG. 16) can include a top 611 and a pair of deformable ribbed arms 612 defining a passage 614 therebetween sized to receive a wire 604. The ribbed arms 612 can be configured to engage an opening 601 by a press-in fit. To secure a wire 604 (FIG. 13) in a channel 602, the wire 604 can be inserted through the passage 614 of one or more clips 610, and the each clip 610 can be pressed into an opening 601 in the channel 602. When a clip 610 is pressed into an opening 601, the ribbed arms are deformed towards each other and, as a result, engage the wire 604 by an interference fit.<br />[0067] The foregoing disclosure provides illustrative embodiments of the invention and is not intended to be limiting. It should be understood that modifications of the disclosed embodiments are possible within the spirit and scope of the invention, and the invention should be construed to encompass such modifications."

The amount of variation generally depends on the specific implementation.<br />[0022] With reference to the Figures, the preferred embodiments will now be described in detail. Generally, the present invention provides an improved system for reactive armor. Structures that may be protected by a reactive armor according to the present invention are vehicles such as tanks, armored personnel carriers, armored fighting vehicles, armored static structures such as buildings, above-ground portions of bunkers or shelters, containers for the storage of water, fuel, chemicals, munitions, and the like. The reactive armor system according to the present invention may be implemented as stand-alone armor, or alternatively may be implemented in connection with (e.g., integrated with) conventional passive armor.<br />[0023] One embodiment is generally directed to reactive armor that includes a casing having a plurality of walls; a back; and a rectangular shaped cavity formed therebetween; a cover that closes the cavity and forms a strike face; a filler placed within the cavity, the filler comprising a disruptive material; and an explosive. The cavity includes sheets of the explosive having edges facing the strike face, the placement of the sheets of the explosive when viewed from the strike face is implemented as four sheets of the explosive that are positioned with major faces against essentially half of a respective inner surface of a wall such that no two sheets of the explosive are adjacent to each other, and such that no two sheets of the explosive directly face each other, and the spaces at the wall that results from the implementation of the explosive on one half of the inner surface of the wall is filled with first sheets of the filler.<br />[0024] The filler further comprises a plurality of second sheets sized similarly to and parallel to the sheets of explosive, and the second sheets of the filler having edges facing the strike face, and the second sheets of the filler are arranged and positioned in four first groupings that are perpendicular to one another within the casing.<br />[0025] The second sheets of the filler may be at least twice as thick as the sheets of the explosive.<br />[0026] Interior to the sheets of the explosive and the first sheets of the filler, the cavity is filled with a plurality of adjacent rods of the filler material having ends facing the back and the strike face. The rods of the filler may be implemented as rows having alternating hexagonal and cylindrical shape, that is, one row of rods of the filler having a hexagonal cross section followed by a row of rods of the filler having a circular cross section. The rods of the filler may be implemented as nested rows having hexagonal shape. The rods of the filler may be implemented as rows having cylindrical shape.<br />[0027] Interior to the sheets of the explosive and the first sheets of the filler, the cavity may be filled with filler that comprises one of (i) a plurality of second sheets or (ii) a block having the major faces positioned to face the back and the strike face.<br />[0028] The explosive may be further implemented within the casing in connection with at least one of the back and the cover as comb shaped quadrants that are at 90 degree intervals of rotation to one another, where each of the quadrants has a first leg that is substantially adjacent to a one half of a respective wall, and a plurality of second legs that extend perpendicular from one side of the respective first leg, and that are directed towards the center of the casing.<br />[0029] The explosive may be further implemented within the casing in connection with at least one of the back and the cover in four second groupings that are at 90 degree intervals of rotation to one another, and each of the second groupings has a first leg that substantially bisects one half of a respective wall and is perpendicular to the respective wall, and a pair of a plurality of second legs that extend perpendicular from a respective first leg and that are directed outward from both sides of the first leg substantially parallel to the wall that is intersected by the first leg, and that are staggered such that the second legs on opposite sides of the first leg do not intersect at the first leg.<br />[0030] Another embodiment may be directed to reactive armor that includes a casing having a plurality of walls; a back; and a rectangular shaped cavity formed therebetween; a cover that closes the cavity and forms a strike face; a filler placed within the cavity, the filler comprising a disruptive material; and an explosive, wherein the cavity includes the explosive interspersed within the cavity between elements of the filler.<br />[0031] The filler may be implemented as adjacent cylindrical rods having circular cross sectional ends that face the back and the strike face and, the explosive is implemented as at least one of cylindrical sticks, rods, and detonation cord that is inserted or threaded in the spaces between the rods of the filler.<br />[0032] The filler may be implemented as adjacent cylindrical rods having circular cross sectional ends that face the back and the strike face, and the filler is implemented in quadrants within the casing wherein the quadrants are defined by sheets of the explosive traversing the interior in a substantially &quot;cross&quot; shape that bisects each of the walls.<br />[0033] The armor cavity may include sheets of the explosive having edges facing the strike face and sheets of the filler having edges facing the strike face, the sheets of the explosive and the sheets of the filler are arranged and positioned in four first groupings within the casing such that adjacent first groupings are perpendicular to one another, the placement of the sheets of the explosive when viewed from the strike face is implemented as a pair of broken-Ts where sheets of the explosive are sandwiched substantially centrally within of the sheets of the filler in the first groupings and oriented upside down with respect to each other.<br />[0034] The explosive may be further implemented within the casing in connection with at least one of the back and the cover in four second groupings that are at 90 degree intervals of rotation to one another, and each of the second groupings has a first leg that substantially bisects one half of a respective wall and is perpendicular to the respective wall, and a pair of a plurality of second legs that extend perpendicular from a respective first leg and that are directed outward from both sides of the first leg substantially parallel to the wall that is intersected by the first leg, and that are staggered such that the second legs on opposite sides of the first leg do not intersect at the first leg.<br />[0035] Yet another embodiment is generally directed to reactive armor including a casing having a plurality of walls, a back, and a rectangular shaped cavity formed therebetween;<br />[0036] a cover that closes the cavity and forms a strike face; a filler placed within the cavity, the filler comprising a disruptive material; and an explosive, wherein, two sheets of the explosive are implemented on the interior surfaces of an opposing pair of the walls.<br />[0037] The filler may further include a plurality of sheets, and the sheets of the filler having edges facing the strike face, the sheets of the filler are positioned with major faces against essentially half of a respective inner surface of a wall and the sheets of the filler are arranged and positioned in four groupings wherein adjacent groupings are perpendicular to one another within the casing.<br />[0038] The filler further may further include a plurality of adjacent sheets of the filler placed with major faces parallel to the sheets of the explosive and with edges positioned to face the back and the strike face.<br />[0039] The filler may further comprise a plurality of adjacently placed rods that are oriented with the longitudinal axes facing the strike face and having the ends directed at the walls not having the explosive on the interior surface.<br />[0040] The explosive may be further implemented within the casing as a plurality of trough configured shaped charges that are positioned to impinge directed forces on the major faces of the sheets of the filler.<br />[0041] Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, an embodiment of a reactive armor (i.e., protective system, apparatus, device, etc.) 100 is shown. Referring to FIG. 1, a sectional view along the 1-1 line of FIG. 2 is shown. The reactive armor 100 generally comprises a casing 102, wherein the casing 102 generally includes four walls (e.g., walls 104a-104d), a back (or base) 106 which is generally positioned away from threats, and a top cover 108 which is nominally (i.e., in most instances) a metal strike face that is subjected to impact from a threat 200. The walls 104 and the back 106 generally form a box-shaped (e.g., prismatic, orthorhombic, cubical, and the like) cavity (e.g., an interior) 110 inside of the casing 102, and the cavity 110 may be closed by the cover 108.<br />[0042] FIG. 2 is a plan view of the armor 100 illustrating the interior of the cavity 110 of the armor with the cover 108 removed for clarity, and broken to illustrate that the dimensions may be varied to meet the design criteria of a particular application. The reactive armor 100 is generally implemented with the casing 102 as a substantially rectangular or square shape when viewed from the strike face as illustrated in FIG. 2. However, other shapes (e.g., circular, oval, hexagonal, irregular, etc.) for the casing 102 may be implemented to meet the design criteria (e.g., shape of the area to be protected) of a particular application. The number of walls 104 will generally correspond to the shape of the cavity 110. For example, when the armor 100 is implemented having a cylindrical shaped cavity 110, there will be a single circular wall 104; and when the armor 100 is implemented having a hexagonal shaped cavity 110, there will be a six walls 104 (e.g., walls 104a-104f). The cover 108 is generally implemented as a removable top that is fastened to the casing 102 via conventional techniques and devices such as bolts, screws, pins, and the like.<br />[0043] When impacting the armor 100, the threat 200 generally causes an intrusion 120 into the cavity 110. The threat 200 and respective intrusion 120 may be one or more projectiles, metal fragments, fluid metals, penetrating jets (&quot;thorns&quot;, &quot;spikes&quot;, etc.) as generated by chemical energy rounds, high energy kinetic rounds, and the like. The armor 100 may potentially mitigate, disrupt, diminish, reduce, and/or eliminate damaging or harmful effects of the intrusion 120 from the threat 200 and collateral effects. The armor 100 is generally positioned such that the cover 108 faces the anticipated direction of the threat 200, and the area to be protected is thus behind the back 106.<br />[0044] Inside the cavity 110, an explosive (e.g., propellant, pyrotechnic, and the like) 122 may be implemented (e.g., applied, placed, affixed, installed, or the like) as at least one of sheets (flat and shaped), lines, strips, cords, rods, and arrays (matrices) on at least one of one or more of the walls 104, the casing back 106, and the cover 108; and a fragmentable disruptive filler material 130 may be implemented as a filler to the cavity 110. The explosive 122 may also extend away from one or more of the walls 104, the back 106, and the cover 108 in the form of one or more granules, rows, sheets, panels, cords, lines, and/or rods into, interstitial to, intermingled with, overlapping with, dispersed within, threaded or woven within, and the like, relative to the filler material 130. When initiated (i.e., ignited, activated, exploded, set off, etc.), the explosive 122 may generate an force, F (shown in phantom). The force, F, alone and generally in combination with the filler 130 may disrupt the intrusion 120.<br />[0045] The explosive 122 that extends into the filler 130 area may be adjacent to or contiguous with the explosive 122 that may be implemented on or against the walls 104, the casing back 106, and the cover 108. The area of coverage on the walls 104 and the casing back 106, as well as the configuration (e.g., composition, potency, type, shape, diameter, thickness, height, width, etc.) of the explosive 122 may be chosen (e.g., calculated, determined, devised, etc.) to meet the design criteria of a particular application (e.g., initiation, sequencing, and direction of the resultant explosive forces, anticipated threat, construction of the casing 102, type and configuration of the explosive 122, type and configuration of material 130, and the like). Further embodiments of the configuration of the type and coverage of the explosive 122 and the filler material 130 are illustrated on FIGS. 3-16, and described in detail below.<br />[0046] The filler 130 comprises a penetrator resistant (e.g., disruptive) material such as sand, glass, ceramic (e.g., silicon nitride, silicon carbide, zirconia, alumina, and the like), borosilicate glass, and the like that are placed within the cavity 110. In some examples, the disruptive filler material 130 may be implemented in a pre-fragmented (e.g., particulate, balls, granules, grains, and the like) state as illustrated on FIGS. 1 and 2.<br />[0047] In other examples, the fragmentable disruptive material 130 may be implemented shaped as blocks; sheets; plates; tiles; rods having cylindrical, hexagonal, or other cross sectional shape; and the like that are placed within the cavity 110. When implemented as blocks, sheets, or plates, the fragmentable material 130 may be implemented having major faces towards the walls 104 in some examples, and implemented having major faces towards the back 106 and the cover 108 in other examples, and in combinational arrangement in yet other examples.<br />[0048] The intrusion 120 generally detonates the explosive 122 such that the explosive material 122 may perform as an initiator and also provide further explosive force generation. That is, the intrusion 120 generally detonates the explosive 122 such that substantially lateral (i.e., inward from the walls 104 and towards the intrusion 120) forces cause the filler 130 to disrupt the intrusion 120 (e.g., via erosion mechanisms and bulking mechanisms). Implementation of such substantially lateral forces, rather than substantially outward (i.e., away from the back 106 and towards the cover 108) forces generally keep the forces and fragmented material 130 inside of the cavity 110, and may potentially reduce the risk of damage to equipment, fratricide, or injury to nearby individuals external to the system 100.<br />[0049] Referring to FIGS. 3 - 13, embodiments of the armor 100 illustrating the interior 110 of the armor with the cover 108 removed (i.e., plan views) are shown. For simplicity but not as a limitation, the casing 102 is shown having a substantially square shape.<br />[0050] Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the interior cavity 110 includes sheets of the explosive 122 and sheets (or plates) of the filler 130 having respective edges facing outward (i.e., toward the strike face 108). The sheets of the explosive 122 and the sheets of the filler 130 are arranged and positioned in quadrants (i.e., in four groupings) that are perpendicular (i.e., rotated 90 degrees) to one another within the casing 102. Four sheets of the explosive 122 are positioned with major faces against (adjacent to) essentially (e.g., about, substantially, and the like) half of a respective wall 104 such that no two sheets of the explosive 122 are adjacent to each other, and such that no two sheets of the explosive 122 directly face each other. The space (gap) at the wall 104 that results from the implementation of the explosive 122 on one half of the inner surface of the wall 104 is generally filled with first sheets of the filler 130. A plurality of second sheets of the filler 130 sized similarly to and parallel to the sheets of explosive 122 extend inward. In the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 4, the second sheets of the filler 130 that are interior within the cavity 110 relative to the sheets of the explosive 122 may be implemented significantly thicker (e.g., at least twice as thick) as the sheets of the explosive 122.<br />[0051] Referring to FIGS. 5-7, the sheets of the explosive material 122 may be implemented on the interior of walls 104 similarly to the embodiments of the armor 100 that are illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4. Likewise, sheets of the filler 130 may be implemented adjacent to the walls 104 to fill the gaps along the walls 104. Interior to the sheets of the explosive 122 and the sheets of the filler 130, the cavity 110 is generally filled with adjacent rods of the filler material 130 having ends facing the back 106 and the strike face 108.<br />[0052] In the embodiment of the armor 100 illustrated on FIG. 5, the rods of the filler 130 are generally implemented as rows (or columns) having alternating hexagonal and cylindrical shape, that is, one row of rods of the filler 130 having a hexagonal cross section followed by a row of rods of the filler 130 having a circular cross section. In the embodiment of the armor 100 illustrated on FIG. 6, the rods of the filler 130 are generally implemented as nested rows (and columns) having hexagonal shape. In the embodiment of the armor 100 illustrated on FIG. 7, the rods of the filler 130 are generally implemented as rows (and columns) having cylindrical shape.<br />[0053] Referring to FIG. 8, the filler 130 may be implemented as adjacent cylindrical rods having circular cross sectional ends that face the back 106 and the strike face 108 similar to the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 7; however, the explosive 122 may be implemented as cylindrical sticks, rods, or detonation cord that is inserted or threaded (woven) in the spaces (gaps) between the rods of the filler 130. When the explosive 122 is implemented as a continuous cord, the explosive 122 generally extends across the inner surfaces of the back 106 and the cover 108 between the rods of the filler 130. Similarly, the explosive 122 may be implemented as a powder, grains, granules, or the like that is placed (dispersed) in the spaces between the rods of the filler 130.<br />[0054] Referring to FIG. 9, the filler 130 may be implemented as adjacent cylindrical rods having circular cross sectional ends that face the back 106 and the strike face 108 similar to the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIGS. 7 and 8; however, the filler 130 may be implemented in quadrants within the casing 102 that are defined by sheets of the explosive 122 traversing the interior 110 in a substantially &quot;+&quot; (&quot;plus&quot; or &quot;cross&quot;) shape that bisects each of the walls 104.<br />[0055] Referring to FIG. 10, the sheets of the explosive material 122 may be implemented on the interior of the walls 104 similarly to the embodiments of the armor 100 that are illustrated on FIGS. 3-7. Likewise, sheets of the filler 130 may be implemented adjacent to the walls 104 to fill the gaps along the walls 104. The remainder of interior 110 to the casing 102 may be filled with the fragmentable filler material 130 in the form of sheets or a block having the major faces positioned to face the back 106 and the strike face 108.<br />[0056] Referring to FIG. 11, two sheets of the explosive material 122 may be implemented on the interior surfaces of an opposing pair of the walls 104. The remainder of the interior 110 may be filled with sheets of the filler 130 similarly to embodiments of the armor 100 that are illustrated on FIGS. 3 and 4.<br />[0057] Referring to FIG. 12, two sheets of the explosive material 122 may be implemented on the interior surfaces of an opposing pair of the walls 104 similarly to embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 11. The remainder of the interior 110 may be filled with adjacent sheets of the filler 130 placed with major faces parallel to the sheets of the explosive 122 and edges positioned to face the back 106 and the strike face 108.<br />[0058] Referring to FIG. 13, the placement of explosive sheets 122 when viewed from the nominal strike face 108, may be implemented as a pair of &quot;broken-Ts&quot; (i.e., the cross bar and the vertical bar of the &quot;T&quot; shape are separated) that are placed (sandwiched) substantially centrally within the sheets of the fragmentable material 130, and oriented upside down with respect to each other. The positioning of the sheets of the filler 130 may be otherwise implemented as four first groupings, arrays, matrices, and the like in quadrants within the casing 102 substantially as illustrated on FIGS. 3 and 4. Alternatively, the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 13 may be described as the sheets of the explosive 122 and the filler 130 are arranged and positioned in quadrants (i.e., in four first groupings) within the casing 102 that are perpendicular (i.e., rotated 90 degrees) to one another in succession, wherein each of the four sheets of the explosive 122 are placed (sandwiched) substantially centrally within the sheets of the fragmentable disruptive material 130.<br />[0059] Referring to FIGS. 14-16, sectional views of the armor 100 when viewed from the side (e.g., with the wall 140b removed) are illustrated. Referring in particular to FIG. 14, a sectional view taken at the line 14-14 of the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 12 is shown. The cover 108 is shown in the typically mounted position.<br />[0060] Referring to FIG. 15, another embodiment of the armor 100 is illustrated. The embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 15 may be implemented similarly to the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 12. However, the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 15 may implement the sheets of the explosive 122 as a plurality of trough configured shaped charges that are positioned to impinge the directed force, F, on the major faces of the sheets of the filler 130. The walls 104a and 104c may be scalloped to provide cavities 160. The cavities 160 may be (i) substantially empty in one example, (ii) filled with the explosive 122 in another example, and (iii) filled with the filler 130 in yet another example.<br />[0061] Referring to FIG. 16, another embodiment of the minor 100 is illustrated. The filler 130 may comprise a plurality of adjacently placed rods that are oriented with the longitudinal axes facing the strike face 108, and having the ends directed at the walls 104 not having the explosive 122 on the interior surface (i.e., the walls 104b and 104d). While cylindrical rods (i.e., rods having a circular cross sectional shape) of the filler 130 are illustrated on FIG. 16, any appropriate cross sectional shape may be implemented.<br />[0062] Referring to FIGS. 17 and 18, example embodiments of the explosive 122 as may be implemented within the casing 102 in connection with the back 106 and the cover 108 are illustrated. For clarity of illustration, the walls 104 are shown in phantom. The explosive 122 may be implemented as arrays (matrices) of strips, rods, cords, or the like. Such an implementation may provide initiation to other implementations of the explosive 122 (e.g., the explosive 122 that is sandwiched with the filler 130, the explosive 122 that is implemented adjacent to the walls 104, and the like), and reduce the outward directed explosive force and thus may potentially reduce or mitigate collateral damage, fratricide, and injury while effectively providing disruption to the intrusion 120.<br />[0063] Referring to FIG. 17, the explosive 122 may be implemented as comb shaped second quadrants (i.e., in four second groupings, explosive) initiators within the casing 102, and that are at 90 degree intervals of rotation to one another. Each of the quadrants may have a first leg (or bar) 140 that is substantially adjacent to a one half of a respective wall 104, and a plurality of second legs (or bars) 142 that extend perpendicular from one side of the respective first leg 140, and that are directed inward (i.e., towards the center of the casing 102). The implementation of the explosive 122 that is illustrated on FIG. 17 may be advantageously implemented in connection with the embodiments of the armor 100 that are illustrated on FIGS. 3-7 and 10.<br />[0064] Referring to FIG. 18, the explosive 122 may be implemented as second quadrants (i.e., in four second groupings, explosive groupings) initiators within the casing 102, and that are at 90 degree intervals of rotation to one another. Each of the quadrants of second groupings may have a first leg (or bar) 150 that substantially bisects one half of a respective wall 104 and is perpendicular to the respective wall 104, and a pair of a plurality of second legs (or bars) 152 that extend perpendicular from a respective first leg 150 and that are directed outward from both sides of the first leg 150 substantially parallel to the wall 104 that is intersected by the first leg 150, and that are staggered such that the second legs 152 on opposite sides of the first leg 150 do not intersect at the first leg 150 and are generally parallel to the sheets of filler 130. The implementation of the explosive 122 that is illustrated on FIG. 18 may be advantageously implemented in connection with the embodiment of the armor 100 that is illustrated on FIG. 13.<br />[0065] As is apparent then from the above detailed description, the present invention may provide an improved system for reactive armor.<br />[0066] Various alterations and modifications will become apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention and it is understood this invention is limited only by the following claims."

This description is an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the invention to the particular embodiments illustrated.<br />[0026] For the purposes of this disclosure, like reference numerals in the figures shall refer to like features unless otherwise indicated.<br />[0027] FIG. 1 shows an embodiment of a crossbow 10 in an undrawn or brace condition. In some embodiments, a crossbow 10 comprises a compound bow portion 20 and a stock portion 40. The bow portion 20 comprises limbs 12, rotatable members 14 and a bowstring 16. The bow portion 20 further comprises a first cable 18 and a second cable 19 that extend between the rotatable members 14. As the crossbow 10 is drawn, the limbs 12 flex and change shape, resulting in movement of the cables 18, 19.<br />[0028] In some embodiments, the bow portion 20 comprises a dual cam bow wherein both rotatable members 14 comprise cams, and cables 18, 19 each comprise a power cable. In some embodiments, the rotatable members 14 and cables 20 are mirrored across a shooting axis 34, desirably providing a system that is substantially laterally balanced.<br />[0029] An arrow or bolt 80 desirably travels along the shooting axis 34 when launched. In some embodiments, the stock 40 extends below said shooting axis 34.<br />[0030] Desirably, the cables 18, 19 are held away from the shooting axis 34, which allows clearance for a bolt 80. Desirably, the first cable 18 is positioned away from the shooting axis 34 in a first direction, and the second cable is positioned away from the shooting axis 34 in a second direction that is different from the first direction. In some embodiments, the first direction is opposite the second direction. In some embodiments, the first cable 18 is positioned above the shooting axis 34 and the second cable is positioned below the shooting axis 34. This arrangement helps to balance forces in the crossbow 10, for example reducing rotatable member 14 lean when compared to a crossbow that routes multiple cables on a common side of the shooting axis 34.<br />[0031] In some embodiments, the crossbow 10 comprises a first cable positioner 48 arranged to position the first cable 18. In some embodiments, the crossbow 10 comprises a second cable positioner 50 arranged to position the second cable 19.<br />[0032] FIG. 2 shows embodiments of a first cable positioner 48 and a second cable positioner 50 in greater detail.<br />[0033] In some embodiments, the first cable positioner 48 comprises a body 24 that is arranged to position the first cable 18 away from the shooting axis 34. As shown in FIG. 2, the body 24 is attached to the stock 40. In some embodiments, the body 24 can be formed integrally with the stock. In some embodiments, the body 24 comprises opposed sidewalls 26 and a top 25. In some embodiments, the body defines a tunnel through which a bolt 80 passes during launch. Desirably, the tunnel is sized to accommodate vanes or fletching of the bolt 80.<br />[0034] In some embodiments, the first cable positioner 48 comprises a recess or channel 49, and the first cable 18 is positioned in the channel 49. In some embodiments, the channel 49 is formed in the body 24. A channel 49 can have any suitable orientation and is desirably oriented to match the first cable 18. For example, the first cable 18 will generally cross the shooting axis 34 at a non-zero angle (e.g. when viewed from above). In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 49 is oriented at an angle to the shooting axis 34, similar to an angle of the first cable 18. It should be noted that the crossing angle of the first cable 18 can be different in the brace and drawn conditions. In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 49 is oriented to match the crossing angle of the first cable 18 in the brace condition. In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 49 is oriented to match the crossing angle of the first cable 18 in the drawn condition. In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 49 is oriented to match an average crossing angle of the first cable 18 in the brace and drawn conditions. In some embodiments, a width of the channel 49 increases at the ends to allow for a change in the crossing angle of the first cable 18.<br />[0035] In some embodiments, a depth of the channel 49 increases at the ends of the channel 49. In some embodiments, a surface of the channel 49 that contacts the first cable 18 (e.g. a bottom surface as shown in FIG. 2) is curved, which helps to distribute the lateral forces applied between the first cable 18 and the channel 49.<br />[0036] In some embodiments, the first cable positioner 48 comprises a guide member 36 arranged to guide and/or be moved by the first cable 18. In some embodiments, the guide member 36 comprises the channel 49. Desirably, the guide member 36 is moveable with respect to the body 24. In some embodiments, the guide member 36 is arranged to traverse along a linear axis 37 with respect to the body 24. In some embodiments, the axis 37 is parallel to the shooting axis 34. In some embodiments, the axis 37 is orthogonal to a longitudinal axis of the channel 49. In some embodiments, the body 24 and the guide member 36 comprise complimentary engagement features that prevent movement in at least one direction. In some embodiments, a guide member 36 comprises one or more flange portions 54 arranged to abut a portion of the body 24. In some embodiments, a flange portion 54 is provided on each side of the guide member 36, and the flanges 54 straddle the body 24. As shown in FIG. 2, the body 24 comprises a ridge 28 and the guide member 36 comprises a groove 38 that receives the ridge 28. The guide member 36 can traverse along the ridge 28 with respect to the body 24. In some embodiments, forces applied to the guide member 36 by the first cable 18 hold the guide member 36 against the body 24.<br />[0037] In some embodiments, the complimentary engagement features of the guide member 36 and the body 24 prevent movement in at least two orthogonal directions. For example, in some embodiments (not shown), a ridge 28 comprises a T-shaped cross-section, and the groove 38 comprises a complimentary T-shape.<br />[0038] In some embodiments, a second cable positioner 50 comprises a body 30 that is arranged to position the second cable 19 away from the shooting axis 34. As shown in FIG. 2, the body 30 comprises a portion of the stock 40. In some embodiments, the body 30 comprises a slot or aperture 42 in the body 30. Thus, in some embodiments, the second cable 19 passes through an aperture 42 in the stock 40, and the stock 40/body 30 holds the second cable 19 away from the shooting axis 34. Desirably, the aperture 42 is of a suitable size to allow for the movement of the second cable 19.<br />[0039] In some embodiments, the body 30 can comprise a separate member that is attached to the stock 40.<br />[0040] In some embodiments, the second cable positioner 48 comprises a recess or channel 51, and the second cable 19 is positioned in the channel 51. In some embodiments, the channel 51 is formed in the body 30. A channel 51 can have any suitable orientation and is desirably oriented to match the second cable 19. For example, the second cable 19 will generally cross the shooting axis 34 at a non-zero angle (e.g. when viewed from above). In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 51 is oriented at an angle to the shooting axis 34, similar to an angle of the second cable 19.<br />[0041] In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 51 is oriented to match the crossing angle of the second cable 19 in the brace condition. In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 51 is oriented to match the crossing angle of the second cable 19 in the drawn condition. In some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the channel 51 is oriented to match an average crossing angle of the second cable 19 in the brace and drawn conditions. In some embodiments, a width of the channel 59 increases at the ends to allow for a change in the crossing angle of the second cable 19.<br />[0042] In some embodiments, a depth of the channel 51 increases at the ends of the channel 51. In some embodiments, a surface of the channel 51 that contacts the second cable 19 (e.g. a top surface as shown in FIG. 2) is curved, which helps to distribute the lateral forces applied between the second cable 19 and the channel 51.<br />[0043] In some embodiments, the second cable positioner 50 comprises a guide member 56 arranged to guide and/or be moved by the second cable 19. In some embodiments, the guide member 56 comprises the channel 51. Desirably, the guide member 56 is moveable with respect to the body 30. In some embodiments, the guide member 56 is arranged to slide within a slot or aperture 42 in the body 30. In some embodiments, the guide member 56 is arranged to traverse along a linear axis (not illustrated) with respect to the body 30. In some embodiments, the linear axis is parallel to the shooting axis 34. In some embodiments, the linear axis is orthogonal to a longitudinal axis of the channel 51. In some embodiments, the body 30 and the guide member 56 comprise complimentary engagement features that prevent movement in one or more orthogonal directions. For example, the body 30 can comprise a ridge and the guide member 56 can comprise a groove that receives the ridge. The guide member 56 can traverse along the ridge with respect to the body 30. In some embodiments, forces applied to the guide member 56 by the second cable 19 hold the guide member 56 against the body 30. In some embodiments, upper and lower surfaces of the body 30 (e.g. inner surfaces of the slot or aperture 42) are positioned to sandwich the guide member 56.<br />[0044] In some embodiments, a first channel 49 is oriented at a predetermined angle to the shooting axis 34, and a second channel 51 is oriented at an equal but opposite angle to the shooting axis 34.<br />[0045] In some embodiments, a first guide member 36 is similar in size and shape to a second guide member 56, but the two guide members 36, 56 have different orientations. In some embodiments, a first guide member 36 is flipped 180 degrees with respect to a second guide member 56.<br />[0046] Cable positioners 48, 50 can be made from any suitable material, such as materials traditionally used in cable positioners or cable guards in compound bows. In some embodiments, at least a portion of a cable positioner 48, 50 comprises metal. In some embodiments, at least a portion of a cable positioner 48, 50 comprises a polymer. Guide members 36, 56 can be formed of any suitable material. In some embodiments, a guide member 36, 56 comprises a polymer. In some embodiments, a guide member 36, 56 comprises a thermoplastic or a thermoset polymer. In some embodiments, a guide member 36, 56 comprises a lubricious polymer. In some embodiments, a guide member 36, 56 comprises a low friction material such as polyoxymethylene (POM) and/or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). In some embodiments, a guide member 36, 56 comprises Delrin.RTM. acetal resin or Delrin.RTM. AF acetal resin available from E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company.<br />[0047] FIG. 3 shows an embodiment of a crossbow 10 in a drawn condition. In general, a latch 11 will hold the bowstring 16 and retain the crossbow 10 in a drawn condition. Actuation of a trigger 13 will release the bowstring 16.<br />[0048] In some embodiments, drawing the bowstring 16 causes the rotatable members to rotate, wherein at least one of the first or second cable 18, 19 will be taken up on a cam track 15. The cable 18, 19 take-up causes the limbs 12 to flex, storing energy.<br />[0049] During a draw cycle, one or more ends of each cable 18, 19 can change position. In some embodiments, the first and second cable positioners 48, 50 change their shape and/or positioning to accommodate movement of the cables 18, 19. For example, in some embodiments, guide members 36, 56 can be moved by the cables 18, 19.<br />[0050] FIGS. 4 and 5 show top views of an embodiment of a crossbow 10. FIG. 4 shows a brace condition and FIG. 5 shows a drawn condition.<br />[0051] FIG. 6 shows an embodiment of a crossbow 10 comprising an embodiment of a first cable positioner 48 and an embodiment of a second cable positioner 50.

US-4887582-A,"There is disclosed a pulley mechanism for a compound bow which allows the drawstring to move through its full range of motion while the compound bow bends only a relatively short distance. Because the compound bow returns to its resting position quickly, the resultant forward motion of the drawstring is faster and thus the arrow moves with greater speed and accuracy. The drawstring pulley of the compound bow is driven by a center gear mating with a fixed gear at the end of the bow arm. The drawstring pulley is thus driven in an orbit around the end of the bow arm. In turn, the compound bow power pulley is driven in an orbit centered by an off-set hub and powered from its center by the motion of the drawstring pulley. The drawstring pulley is free to revolve on full revolution while the power pulley only revolves one-half turn. Because the actural circumference of the power pulley is round while the pulley circumscribes an elliptical arc (due to the off-set center point) there is a smoth &quot;break-over&quot; when the drawstring is released. Arrow quiver is reduced by the smooth break-over as well as by the reduced arc through which the bow ends must move upon release of the drawn bow string.","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br />For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the invention, reference should be had to the following detailed description taken in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:<br />FIGS. 1 and 2 show side and rear views of the pulley system mounted on a compound bow with the bow in the rest or quiescent position;<br />FIG. 3 shows a side view of the pulley system mounted on a compound bow with the bow in the drawn position;<br />FIG. 4 is a side view of the pulley system;<br />FIG. 5 is a side view of the pulley system with certain structures removed to show the relationship between the pulleys;<br />FIG. 6 is a rear view of the pulley system with structures of one of the pulleys removed to show the gear relationships;<br />FIG. 7 shows the pulley system, left to right, in various states from rest to fully drawn; and<br />FIG. 8 is an exploded view of the pulley system.<br />Similar reference characters refer to similar parts throughout the several views of the drawings.<br />(1) DETAILED DISCUSSION<br />(2) Turning now to FIG. 1, there is shown compound bow 13 resting in the normal or quiescent position. Bow 13 has hand grip section 23 and pulley 10 mounted on upper and lower limbs 20. Power or tension cables 14 and 15 serve to interconnect the pulley of one limb with the opposite limb. Drawstring 16 interconneects the upper and lower limb pulleys.<br />(3) FIG. 2 shows the rear view of bow 13. Tines 21 can be seen at the top and bottom limbs. Between these tines, pulleys 10 are pinned via pin 22 in the manner to be discussed hereinafter. Tines 21 can be seen in more detail in FIG. 6.<br />(4) In FIG. 3 the compound bow is shown in the drawn position with drawstring 16 pulled backward. In this position, the drawstring has unwound from its control pulleys causing tension cables 14 and 15 to wind on their respective control pulleys thereby forcing limb ends 20 to bend back and down slightly. The backwards bend is shown by &quot;A&quot; in FIG. 3, while the downwards bend is shown by &quot;B&quot;. As will be seen, upon the relase of drawstring 16, the power of the bow ends returning to their quiescent position pulls drawstring 16 forward while at the same time causing its control pulley 10 to rotate as the tension cable pulley rotate in response to the unwinding of the tension cables. This will be seen in more detail from that which follows.<br />(5) FIG. 4 shows tine 21 at the limb end which, for our discussion, can be the upper or lower limb end since the same mechanism is repeated at both ends. Assuming that FIG. 4 shows the upper limb end, then tension cable 14 begins on pulley 12 and extends downward and is connected to the lower limb end 20 in the same manner as cable 15 is connected to the upper limb end, as shown in FIG. 6. Note that cable 15 can end in a bridle, thus being connected to support 62 as well as support 61. Thus, when pulley system 10 rotates, tension cable 14 is free to wind upon circumferential rim 12 thereby bending the other or lower limb end. Of course the same is true for tension cable 15 which is pulled downward by the winding of pulley 12 at the lower end (not shown).<br />(6) In the quiescent position, drawstring 16 is wound onto the circumferential rim of cam 11. Drawstring 16 being pulled into the drawn position causes pulley 11 to rotate in the clockwise direction thereby causing pulley 12 (the tension pulley) to also rotate in the clockwise direction. The exact relationship between these two pulleys will be detailed hereinafter.<br />(7) FIG. 5 shows a cut away view of pulley system 10 showing the relationship of the two pulleys 11 and 12. In the embodiment shown, gear 51 is attached at the center of pulley 11 by neck 40. Gear 51 could be any friction surface for defining an orbit. Gear 51 is rigidly affixed to neck 40 so that as it rotates the entire pulley 11 also rotates. Thus, force applied to the rim of pulley 11, by pullng drawstring 16, will cause that pulley to rotate around gear 50 which is fixed stationery to the end of tine 21. The exact motion of the respective pulley and their pulleys will be shown later in th detailed discussion.<br />(8) FIG. 6, shows th two tine ends 21 of upper limb 20. Pivot pin 22 extends between the tines and holds pulley set 10 in place and acts as the axle for the system. The ends of this pin are locked via locking washers 83. Spacer 62 is inserted on pin 22 and pulley 12 is then put on the pin 22 followed by pulley 11. Also on pin 22 is bracket 60 which supports fixed gear 50 in position.<br />(9) Bracket 60 contains neck 61 to which cable end 15 is attached. Tension cable 14 is shown extending to a groove cut in the circumferential rim of pulley 12 and locked onto the rim via a set screw (shown in FIG. 8). The same is true for drawstring 16 with respect to pulley 11. While now shown, cable 14 must wind around pulley 12 at least one full turn since, during operation, pulley 12 rotates through approximately 360 degrees. The amount of rotation of pulley 12 determines ultimate draw length.<br />(10) Turning now to FIG. 7, there is shown tine 21 moving from the quiescent position on the far left to the fully drawn position on the far right. Shown for reference in dotted lines are two intermediate positions showing the rotation of cams 12 and 11 around pivot point 22 at the end of the limb arm. Note that in the quiescent position, tension cable 14 is extended to the left of pin 22 a distance of roughly one inch while drawstring cable 16 is approximately 1/2 inch to the right of pin 22. As drawstring 16 is pulled back, pulley 11 rotates, rotating pulley 12 causing arms 21 to bend. In the final drawn position, tension cable 14 is very near to pin 22 while drawstring 16 is now much further away from pin 22. When cable 16 is in this fully drawn position the forces are such that little relative force is required to keep the bow bent once the drawstring is pulled back because of the relative leverage points of the two cams 11 and 12. Note that the relative sizes of the cams can be changed and the cams can be out of round thereby changing the speed and breakover characteristics of the bow. As shown, the breakover reduction is approximately fifty percent.<br />(11) Turning now to FIG. 8, we can see the various parts of pulley set 10 which controls the compound bow. Pin 22 extends between tine ends 21 of the upper bow limb and is held in position by locking washers 83. Fixed gear 50, which in the embodiment is shown detachable from tine end 21 via bracket 60, is slipped over the end of tine 21. Bracket 60 has neck 61 for holding the tension cable which extends from the opposite limb. Bracket 60, neck 61 and gear 50 are a unitary structure. Pulley 11 is then fitted over gear 50 such that gear 51 is in meshing contact with fixed gear 50. The gears provide positive traction and any mechanism, such as a wheel, can be used to rotate pulley 11 around an orbit defined by gear 50. The relative distance of this orbit can be controlled by the diameter of either of these wheels, thereby changing the operational characteristics of the system. The relative placement of the gears will also effect the draw length.<br />(12) Note also that pulley 11 has an outer rim which is separate from the center section with the center section being open except for neck 40 which extends downwards into the center of the rim holding the orbit defining gear 51 in position for rotation around center hub 80 of pulley 12.<br />(13) Pulley 12 is shown having hole 84 in its circumferential rim into which tension cable 14 is inserted and locked via screw 86. This is the same locking mechanism used for pulley 11 where screw 87 locks drawstring 16 into hole 85.<br />(14) Center hub 80 is permanently affixed to gear 12 and in one embodiment, has a center tap therein. The outer bearing surface of hub 80 is adapted to mate with the inner surface of gear 51 such that when pulleys 11 and 12 are mated together hub 80 goes through the center planetary of gear 51 and is held in place by screw 41. Of course this mechanism can be replaced by any other mechanism types which serve to hold the two pulleys together and allows free turning of both pulleys with respect to each other.<br />(15) Turning crank 81 is off-center from hub 80 and closer to the circumferential rim of pulley 12. Crank 81 extends through the hollow inner section of pully 11 and is inserted through the center of gear 50. This in turn allows pulley 12 to rotate around a center point defined by the center of off-set crank 81 and driven by hub 80 as pulley 11 is forced to orbit gear 50. Because of the open section on the internal section of pulley 11, pulley 11 is free to rotate one full turn while pulley 12 rotates one-half turn as has been demonstrated. Pin 22 extends through tine 21 and through crank 81, gear 50, support 60 to the opposite tine 21, thereby creating an axle around which gear system 10 rotates.<br />(16) Conclusion<br />(17) While a pulley system has been discussed in which the two pulleys are shown round with interlocking drive gears it is understood that many variations of this concept can be designed, all within the spirit and scope of the invention. For example the round pulleys could be oval-shaped to provide even more forward acceleration to the drawstring. The pitch of the gear teeth can be modified to control friction. Many other additional adjustments can be made to reduce friction, such as better pivot bearings and perhaps a different balance and size of one or the other of the pulleys. Also, the gears themselves can be made in the form of cams to change the motion of the wind-up and wind-down of the pulley system.<br />(18) A shield can be constructed for protecting the gears. This shield can be connected to one of the gears, for example, gear 12, and can rotate therewith while covering both gears. This shield would be an added safety factor.<br />(19) The present disclosure includes that contained in the appended claims as well as that of the foregoing description. Although this invention has been descirbed in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularlity, it is understood that the present disclosure of the preferred form has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes in the details of construction and the combination and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention."

Seyle, Santa Monica, Calif., assignors to Del Mar Engineering Laboratories, Los Angeles, Calif., a corporation of California Filed June 20, 1960, Ser. No. 37,158 3 Claims. (Cl. 273-105.3) This invention relates to apparatus for use on airborne ;hidles for producing visible signals to facilitate the de- ction and tracking of the vehicles. More particularly, .is invention pertains to remotely controlled apparatus ir producing smoke signals and for igniting flares at an imanned aircraft such as a drone or a towed target.<br />(3) Apparatk~s for producing smoke signals at a towed air- *aft is disclosed in the pending patent application Serial .o. 550,995, filed on December 5, 1955, by Bruce E. Del [ar, now Patent No. 2,945,222. The apparatus includes noke signal devices, each having a collapsible container aa discharge nozzle through which the smoke signals re provided. The devices may be operated in succes- on under control of signals from a remote location. Ap- aratus for successively igniting flares at a towed target is isclosed in the Patent 2,869,120, granted to 0. B. Lol- iaugh, W. E. Thornton, and Charles A. Smith on Janu- ry 13, 1959.<br />(4) In apparatus of this type, exemplified by the Del Mar ending application and the Lolmaugh et al. patent, the rogramming of the particular visible signals is rigid.<br />(5) 'he flares, for example, are ignited in order responsive to .iccessive control signals from a remote location. There re many'applications, however, where different programs f visible signals are desired without utilizing a different awed target for each program.<br />(6) In a specific illustrative embodiment of this invention, remotely controlled airborne vehicle is provided having pparatus for providing any one of a number of different rograms of visible signals in the form of combinations of moke puffs and flares. The program may be selected ither manually before flight or by remote control during light. The same airborne vehicle may, accordingly, be utilized to provide completely different programs of visible ignals at different times. In one program, illustratively, . large number of spaced smoke puffs may be provided .nd in another a salvo of flares may he ignited.<br />(7) Features of the invention pertain to the provision of neans for halting any program of visible signals while he airborne vehicle is in flight and for selecting another zrogram for the remaining smoke and flare apparatus on he vehicle. Further features of this invention relate to he provision of means for remotely adjusting the repeti- ion rate for providing the successive smoke puffs during light. Control signals at the airborne vehicle are re- :eived over two channels; the first to adjust or change the )rogram, and the second to successively initiate different tages of the program. The signals over the first channel )perate switching means for selecting any one of a large lumber of programs. When signals are received over the irst channel in the middle of any visible signal program, he program is automatically halted. The new program is ;elected and initiated at any stage of the program. To ;hange the stage of the program without igniting any lares, switching means responsive to signals simultane- 3usly received over both channels are provided for ;hanges in stages and inhibiting the ignition of the flares.<br />(8) In the specific illustrative embodiment, the airborne vehicle is a supersonic target and the smioke signal ap..<br />(9) 3aratus includes a number of cartridges which are oper- ited by igniting small explosives or squibs. When a squib .s set off, it ejects a piston from the vehicle which carries with it the powder forming the smoke puff. Features of the invention relate to the provision of an expendable piston having a wire frame for maintaining the alignment of the piston during ejection from the supersonic vehicle.<br />(10) The piston walls and base of the cartridge are mounted on an electrical plug for ready disassembly for refilling.<br />(11) The cartridges are mounted in a central removable section of the target. If smoke signals are not required in the programs, the section may be removed and the target then has provision only for flares. The removable see- tion includes a number of electrical jacks which mate with the electrical plugs of the cartridges.<br />(12) Further advantages and features of this invention will become apparent upon consideration of the following description when read in conjunction with the drawing wherein:<br />(13) FIGURE 1 is a partial sectional view of the supersonic target illustrating the powder cartridges and the flares utilized in the visible signalling system of this invention;<br />(14) FIGURE 2 is a rear view of the supersonic target illustrating the flares utilized in the visible signalling system of this invention;<br />(15) FIGURE 3 is a sectional view of the smoke cartridge utilized in the visible signalling system of this invention;<br />(16) FIGURE 4 is a side view of the jack and a smoke cartridge of the visible signalling system of this invention illustrating how the cartridge is supported in the jack;<br />(17) FIGURE 5 is a partial sectional view of the cartridge utilized in the visible signalling system of this inventon illustrating the movement of its expendable piston; and FIGURE 6 is a partial circuit and partial functional representation of the visible signalling system of this invention.<br />(18) Referring first to FIGURES 1 and 2, a streamlined tow target 10 is depicted having suitably reinforced thin walls of molded paper. The tow target 10 has a set of tail vanes 19 for stabilizing the flight of the target 10. The tow target 10 has an integral rigid probe 12 which is of slender and tapered configuration. The nose probe 12 has a swivel joint 12a for attaching the tow cable, not shown, to the target 19. An aircraft, also not shown, tows the target 10 by means of the tow cable attached to the swivel joint 12a of the nose probe 12. Tow targets of this general type having a nose probe and being suitable for supersonic flight are disclosed in the above-identified Del Mar Patent 2,869,120 and also in a copending patent application Serial No. 617,569, filed by Robert J. Hopper and Boyd B. Elder on October 22, 1956, now Patent No.<br />(19) 2,953,442.<br />(20) The tow target 10 includes a number of radar reflectors 15, 16 and 17 which facilitate the detection of the tow target 10 by remotely located radar equipment. The tow target 10 also includes means which can be remotely controlled for providing visible signals to facilitate the visual detection of the target 10. The means for provid- 5ing the visual signals includes a number of flares 22 through 25 which extend rearwardly from the tow target 10 and a marker assembly 30 in the central portion of the tow target 10. As is hereinafter described, the marker assembly 30 includes a relatively large number of powder cartridges 40 for providing smoke signals or puffs. Both the smoke signals and the flare signals are controlled in a multistage adjustable program which can be pre-selected or which can be adjusted from a remiote location during flight. t'he marker assemibly 30 may be assemibled separately and then the forward and aft portions of the tow target 10 attached thereto. If the provision of smoke signals is not required, the marker asseumbly 30 is not incorporated in the tow target 10. ihe resulting tow target is then somewhat shorter or a spacer panel ulay be utilized instead of the marker assembly 30 to provide a target of similar length.<br />(21) As indicated above, the marker assembly 30 includes a number of powder cartridges 40. Illustratively, the marker assembly 30 may include twenty-four smoke cartridges 40. Each of the cartridges 40, which are depicted particularly in FIGURES 3 through 5, provides for one smoke puff when it is operated. The smoke puff is formed from- a fluorescent powder 39 in each of the cartridges 40 which may be an inert paint pigment. Illustratively, a fluorescent fire orange pigment designated A-14 powder and manufactured by the Switzer Bros. Inc., of Cleve- land, Ohio, may be utilized. As shown in FIGURES 3 through 5, the cartridges 40 may include a plug 41 for mounting the cartridge in a jack 42. The cartridges 40 are, accordingly, readily replaceable in the marker assembly 30.<br />(22) As shown specifically in FIGURE 3, electrical connections are provided from the plug 41 to a squib 43 in the cartridge 40. The squib 43, which consists of an explosive material that can be ignited by an electrical cur- rent, is positioned between a backing plate 44 and a movable ejector or piston 45. The squib 43 may, illus- tratively, have a 1.5 grain charge and be of the type designated S-75 manufactured by the E. I. du Pont de Nemnours &amp; Co., Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware.<br />(23) The piston 45 includes a wire frame ejector member 45a which is enclosed by a cylindrical casing 46 of the cartridge 40. The member 45a is a crossed wire arrangement supported on a disc 45b. The disc 45b, which may be made of aluminum, is supported on a ring 33 affixed to the side of the casing 46. The ring 38 forms a shoulder for supporting the piston 45 in the casing 46. The space between the disc 45b and a lid 48 is filled with the smoke powder 39. The lid 48, which may be made of aluminum, is glued to the end of the casing 46.<br />(24) When ejected into the airstream, the powder 39 forms a smoke puff which is readily visible at a considerable distance.<br />(25) The wire frame 45a of the piston 45 functions as a guide to maintain the base or disc 45b of the piston 45 in substantial transverse alignment to the axis of the cylindrical casing 46 during the ejection movement of the piston 45. The frame member 45a consists of two crossed wires of rectangular configuration, the ends 45d of which are inserted in holes in the disc 45b. The crossed wires may be welded together at their crossing.<br />(26) As illustrated in FIGURES 3 and 5, the ends 45d are bent about the opposite sides of the disc 45b to form a relatively rigid structure.<br />(27) When the squib 43 is exploded by electrical current introduced through the plug 41, the pressure formed in the space between the backing plate 44 and the base or disc 45b of the piston 45 forces the frame member 45a of the piston 45 against the lid 48. The glued connection holding the lid 48 to the casing 46 breaks under the pressure so that the lid 48 is ejected from the assembly 30 followed by the piston 45 filled with the smoke powder. In this manner, the lid 48 and the piston 45 are ejected from the towed aircraft 10 when the squib 43 of the cartridge 40 is exploded. FIGURE 5 illustrates how the wire frame member 45b of the piston 45 keeps the piston 45 in substantial alignment until the end of its travel in the casing 46 of the cartridge 40.<br />(28) Means for maintaining the alignment is required because the piston 45 is ejected from the side of a supersonic target 10 and because the squib may develop uneven pressures against the disc 45b. The relatively high fluid pressure along the sides of the target 10 during flight tends to force the piston to rotate as it moves out of the casing 46.<br />(29) The frame member 45a also provides for the quick dispersion of the powder in the air streamt. A cylindrically shaped, solid surface, piston would not provide for a rapid or adequate dispersion of the powder. As the piston is ejected, there is little inhibition to the rapid powder dispersion and smoke puff formation.<br />(30) As indicated above, and as shown in FIGURE 4, t plug 41 supports the cartridge 40 in the jack 42.<br />(31) washer or ring 47 is provided on the cartridge 40 whi engages a clip 49 attached to the jack 42. A finger 4:<br />(32) of jack 42 engages the tip of the plug 41 when the pli 41 is inserted in the jack 42. The clip 49 bears agair the ring 47 to hold the plug 41 in the jack 42. Tor move the cartridge 40, the clip 49 is moved away fro the ring 47, as indicated by the dashed lines, so that tl plug 41 can be removed from the jack 42.<br />(33) The cartridges 40 in the marker assembly 30 are utiliz to provide first visual signals, and the flares 22 throul 25, shown in FIGURES 1 and 2, are utilized to provii second visual signals. The signals are provided as pa of any one of a number of programs of visual signE which can be preselected before flight or which can 1 selected during flight utilizing a communication syste including a receiver 32 in FIGURE 6.<br />(34) Referring to FIGURE 6, the radio receiver 32 at tl towed aircraft 10 functions to receive command sign, from a remote location. The remote location may either at the towing aircraft, not shown, or at a grout position. The command signals may also be transmitti from another aircraft as for example an aircraft whib attacking the towed target 10. The command signs are provided through two communication channels to t] radio receiver 32. One of the two channels is utiliz( to initiate the different steps or stages of a program visual signals, and the other of the channels is utilizf for adjusting or changing the program.<br />(35) The receiver 32 has two output terminals 1 and 2 which the signals in the two channels are respective provided. The signals may be pulses of relatively loi duration modulated on two different subcarriers. Illu tratively, the pulse duration may be 5 seconds. TI receiver 32 includes means, not shown, for recovere and separating the subcarriers and then for demodula ing the subcarriers to recover the pulsed command signal As indicated above, the visual indication in the for.<br />(36) of smoke puffs and flares may be provided as parts4 different programs of indications. A seven-position s lector switch 65 in the target 10 may be preset to dete mine the particular program of visual signals to be pri vided by the towed aircraft 10. The switcha 65 may 1 manually set before flight or it may be stepped by stepping relay 65wv during flight. In the specific illustrn tive embodiment of this invention, the tow target 10 ca ries four flares 22-25 and twenty-four cartridges 41 In FIGURE 6, the twenty-four squibs 4Ga-40x of tI cartridges 40 are aligned along the right of the figure ar the four squibs 22a-25a of the flares 22-25 are aligne along the bottom of the figure. The present it vention is not restricted to any particular number flares and smoke cartridges as their specific numbers at merely illustrative.<br />(37) The seven different programs each include one to fot different stages, and each stage of a program requires separate start pulse over the second channel of the ri ceiver 32 to its output terminal 2. The following tab] lists the smoke and flare signals provided during the stage of the seven programs which may be selected by settin the seven-position selector switch 65:<br />(38) Posttton 5--------------- 6 -- - - - - - - - - - - 7------------------- Program Stages 1 2 a 12 puffs---. 2 flares----. 12 puffs---. 2flares.<br />(39) 12puffs--- 4 flares--------- 12 puffs _- 12 puffs -_ 4 flares _- 24 puffs--- 4 flares___------ flare-----flare_- flare--flare.<br />(40) 2 flares--..- 2 flares___------ 4 flares------- Assume first that the selector switch 65 is set at it position 1 and that it is not desired to adjust the pro ram during flight. Each pulse through the second chan- ,l initiates one of the four stages of the program. The rst pulse received at the radio receiver 32 and pro- ided at its output terminal 2 operates a relay 50. One rminal of the winding of relay 50 is connected to the atput terminal 2 of the radio receiver 32, and its other rminal is connected to a source 51 of a positive poten- al. When the relay 50 operates, it completes a path )r energizing a winding 55 of a stepping relay 62. The inding 55, shunted by a resistor 60, is coupled on one de by the operated armature 2 of the relay 50 to a )mmon ground connection, and on the other side to a otential source 53.<br />(41) When the winding 55 is energized, the relay 62 is nabled and at the termination of the energization of the 'inding 55, the relay 62 steps to its next position. The ;epping relay 62 has three contact arms and three sets f four contacts 1-4 associated respectively with the free contact arms. The arms are at contacts 4 before ie first pulse is received at the receiver 32.<br />(42) At the end of the first pulse, the relay 62 advances -om its position 4 to its position 1. When the stepping -lay 62 advances from its position 4 to its posi- on 1, it provides a connection from the source 3 through the resistor 60, the switch 62 and a pole or ank 65g of the switch 65 to an adjustable timer 70.<br />(43) 'he switch 65 has seven ganged poles 65a-65g, each of ,'hich has seven contacts 1-7. As indicated above in axe program table for position 1, twelve smoke puffs are uccessively provided. During the first stage, the smoke uffs are provided under control of the adjustable timer '0. The period of the adjustable timer may, illustra- ively, be 4.25 seconds so that it provides a series of ulses at 4.25 second intervals from the time it is started y the stepping relay 62 until it is stopped. The operat- 'ag path to the start lead of the timer 70 is from the ,rounded resistor 60 through a contact 1 of relay 62, nd the contact 1 of pole 65g of switch 65. The dura- ion of each pulse from the timer 70 may, illustratively, )e 200 milliseconds.<br />(44) The pulses from the adjustable timer 70 are provided o a, winding, 80wv of a twenty-four position stepping relay t0. The winding 80w is associated with two poles or yanks 80a and 80b, each consisting 'of twenty-four con- acts. The successive pulses from the adjustable timer F0 step the switch 80 from one position to the next and he stepping sequence continues until the timer 70 is salted. The pulses from the timer 70 are also provided hrough the successive contacts of the bank 80a to the :quibs 40a-40x, described above, which are associated herewith. In this manner, the pulses through the bank Ifla function to successively fire the twelve squibs 40a hrough 40L inclusive.<br />(45) When the switch 80 reaches position 12, the negative ?ulse provided from the adjustable timer 70, is coupled hrough the pole 88 and a diode 76 to the stop terminal )f the adjustable timer 70. The adjustable timer 70 is, accordingly, automatically halted when the switch 80 reaches its twelfth position. The system remains in this -ondition with the adjustable timer 70 halted, the switch 30 at position 12 and the stepping switch 62 at position 1, antil the next pulse is received over the second channel at the radio receiver 32. The first stage of the program of visual -signals has, in this manner, been completed.<br />(46) The next received start pulse initiates the second stage of the, program.<br />(47) When the second pulse is received, it pulses the relay 50 to in turn step the switch 62 to position 2. As indicated above in the table of the selector programs, two flares are simultaneously ignited during the second stage.<br />(48) With the switch 62 at position 2, the battery 53 is coupled through the resistor 60, switch 62 at position 2, through the pole 65b to the squib 24a and also through the pole 65a to the squib 25a. 'The squibs 22a-25a, as indicated above, are respectively part of the flares 2Z through 25 at the rear of the tow target 10. One terminal of each of the squibs 22a-24a is multipled through a normally enabled gate 36 to ground. As is hereinafter desrcibed, when the gate 36 is disabled, the path to ground is opened. The two squibs 24a and 25a of the flares 24 and 25 are ignited when the potential source 53 is connected thereto by the switch 62. During the second stage of the program, two flares are, ac- cordingly, simultaneously ignited.<br />(49) The third stage is initiated when a third pulse is received over the second channel at the receiver 32. The third pulse steps the switch 62 to its third position to again initiate the operation of the adjustable timer 70.<br />(50) The connection is provided from the source 53 through resistor 60, the switch 62 at position 3, and pole 65e of the switch 65 to the start terminal of the adjustable timer 70. 'As described above, the switch 80 was halted at its terminal 12 at the end of the first stage of the program.<br />(51) The adjustable timer 70 steps the switch 80 through its positions 13 through 24 to successively fire the squibs 40m-40x corresponding to these positions. A second series of smoke puffs is, accordingly, provided spaced at intervals of 4.25 seconds. When the switch 80 reaches position 24, the pulse from the adjustable timer 70 is provided through the pole 80a at position 24 and a diode 79 to the stop terminal of the adjustable timer 70. The timer 70 is, accordingly, halted to terminate the third ,stage of the program.<br />(52) When the fourth pulse is received over the second channel at the receiver 32, the switch 62 is stepped in its fourth position to fire the last two flares. The operating potential is coupled through the switch 62 and poles 65d and 65c' to the squibs 22a and 23a respectively. In this manner, 'the four stages of the program selected by the switch 65 are succesively initiated by the four pulses received over the second channel. As described above, the switch 65 may be set in any one of seven different positions to select seven different programs. As another illustration of the programs which can be selected by the switch 65,, assume that the switch 65 is set at its position 7. With the switch 65 at position 7, the first pulse over the second channel-fires a salvo of all four 'flares 22 through 25. Operating potential is provided through the switch 62 at position 1 through all four poles 65a-65d of the switch 65 at position 7 to the squibs 22a- 25a. Succeeding pulses do not have any affect because only a single stage is utilized for the program selected by the switch 65 at its position 7. Any one of the seven programs may, accordingly, be manually selected before flight, and each stage of the selected program can be 'initiated by remote control during flight.<br />(53) During flight, a program may be halted even if it has been initiated. Moreover, the program may be changed, the selected stage may be changed and the timing of the adjustable timer 70 may also be changed. The programming is, accordingly, quite flexible. The signals for these controls are provided through the first channel of the radio receiver 32. In order to change the program, the switch 65 is stepped by energizing its winding 65w.<br />(54) The pulses received through the first channel of the radio receiver 32 are provided through a normally enabled gate 73 to the winding 65w. If the switch 65 was preset to its position 1 and it is desired, illustratively, to select the sixth program, five pulses are transmitted and coupled to the winding 65w to step the switch 65 from its first to its sixth position. 'Thereafter, the second channel of the radio receiver 32 is utilized to initiate the stages of the selected sixth program.<br />(55) TIhe first pulse received through the first channel also functions to set a ,flip-flop circuit 37. The circuit 37 disables the gate 36 to open the operating circuit for the squibs 22a-25a to prevent their ignition during the pro- gran changing sequence.<br />(56) 'ihe pulses through the first channel are also provided though a diode 75 to the stop terminal of the adjustable tither 70. If a sequence of smoke puffs is, accordingly, in progress under the control of the adjustable timer 70, a pulse received through the first channel will halt the adjustable timer 70. If it is desired to halt the timer 70 and yet maintain the same program, seven pulses are provided through the first channel so that the switch 65 is returned to its initial position.<br />(57) The seventh pulse through the first channel functions also to set a flip-flop circuit 72, the function of which is hereinafter described. The flip-flop circuit 72 is operated by a 10 stage counter 74 coupled to the output terminal 1 of the radio receiver 32. The counter 74 keeps track of the pulses received through the first channel of the radio receiver 32. The timing of the adjustable timer 70 may be changed utilizing a number of pulses greater than 7 through the first channel. In the specific illustrative embodiment, three different adjustments of the timer 70 are provided. These adjustments are provided respectively when 8, 9 or 10 pulses are received through the first channel of the receiver 32.<br />(58) The seventh pulse through the first channel steps the counter 74 to its seventh position to operate the flip-flop circuit 72. When the flip-flop circuit 72 operates, it disables the gate 73 so that subsequent pulses through the first channel are not provided to the winding 65w of the switch 65. The eight pulse is provided from the counter 74 through a cable 74c to the adjustable timer 70. Sim- ilarly, the ninth and tenth pulses are provided thereto.<br />(59) These pulses at the timer 70 function to adjust the timing between successive pulses to change the spacing of the smoke puffs in the slip stream.<br />(60) After an adjustment, either of the program or timing, the first pulse through the second channel of the radio receiver 32 functions to reset the counter 74 and to reset the flip-flop circuit 37 and the flip-flop circuit 72 if it has been set. When relay 50 operates responsive to the first pulse over the second channel the ground connection is coupled through its armature 1 to the reset terminals of the counter 74 and the flip-flop circuits 72 and 37. These components are, accordingly, returned to normal. If it is desired to both adjust the timing and to change the program, the timing is first adjusted. Then, a pulse is provided simultaneously through the two channels to reset the counter 74 and the flip-flop circuit 72 but yet to prevent the initiation of the program. The pulse through the second channel resets the counter 74 and the flip-flop circuits 72 and 37, and the pulse through the first channel 2 insures that the time 70 remains stopped and that the gate 36 is disabled. Thereafter, the program can be changed in the manner described above. If it is desired to change the setting of the switch 63 for the stage selection, additional pulses may be provided through the first channel but it is accompanied by a pulse through channel 2 to prevent supplying visual signals during the adjustment. In this manner, the programming of the visual signals is quite flexible and may readily be adjusted during flight as well as on the ground. The pro- gram, program stage and timing between puffs may all be changed by remote control.<br />(61) Although this invention has been disclosed and illustrated with reference to particular applications, the principles involved are suspectible of numerous other applications which will be apparent to persons skilled in the art.<br />(62) The invention is, therefore, to be limited only as indicated by the scope of the appended claims."

With reference now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>, the moving target device <b>10</b> is shown mounted on a post assembly <b>12</b>. The moving target device <b>10</b> comprises a target mounting frame <b>14</b> having a target <b>16</b> positioned therein, a pivot assembly <b>18</b>, a guard <b>20</b>, an upper support arm <b>22</b>, and a stop plate <b>24</b>. The arm <b>22</b> is used to attach or secure the moving target device <b>10</b> to the post assembly <b>12</b>. The moving target device <b>10</b> is shown in a shooting position <b>26</b> in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref> and also shown in phantom in a non-shooting position <b>28</b>. In particular, a shooter will aim at the target <b>16</b> to shoot at the target <b>16</b> when the moving target device <b>10</b> is in the shooting position <b>26</b> as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref>. Also, when the target <b>16</b> is in the non-shooting position <b>28</b> a shooter will not be able to see or shoot at the target <b>16</b>. Although the post assembly <b>12</b> is shown as being movable, it is possible and contemplated that the post assembly <b>12</b> may be secured in place such as to an existing metal post or pole. Although the guard <b>20</b> and the stop plate <b>24</b> are shown as being separate components, it is contemplated that the guard <b>20</b> and the stop plate <b>24</b> may be a unitary construction.<br />(9) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a partial front perspective view of the moving target device <b>10</b> in the shooting position <b>26</b>. The moving target <b>10</b> has the target mounting frame <b>14</b> which comprises a left side arm <b>30</b> having a retaining tab <b>32</b>, a bottom arm <b>34</b>, and a right side arm <b>36</b> having a retaining tab <b>38</b>. The target mounting frame <b>14</b> is used to hold the target <b>16</b> therein. The target <b>16</b> may consist of a paper target <b>40</b> attached to a board <b>42</b>. By use of the target mounting frame <b>14</b>, the target <b>16</b> may be easily inserted into the target mounting frame <b>14</b> and removed when a shooting event has been completed. The paper target <b>40</b> can have any type target printed thereon such as an outline of a human <b>44</b> having concentric ovals <b>46</b> representing different scoring options. As can be appreciated, the target <b>16</b> may be of a unitary construction in which the paper target <b>40</b> and the board <b>42</b> are formed as a single unit.<br />(10) The moving target device <b>10</b> is also shown having the upper support arm <b>22</b> and a lower support arm <b>46</b> connected to the post assembly <b>12</b>. The moving target device <b>10</b> may be easily removed from the post assembly <b>12</b> by removing the arms <b>22</b> and <b>46</b> from the post assembly <b>12</b>. The pivot assembly <b>18</b> is connected to the upper arm <b>22</b> and the lower arm <b>46</b>. The pivot assembly <b>18</b> is capable of moving the target <b>16</b> between the shooting position <b>26</b> and the non-shooting position <b>28</b>, as will be explained in detail herein. The guard <b>20</b> is used to shield or protect various other components (not shown) of the moving target device <b>10</b> from being struck by a bullet or other projectile.<br />(11) With reference now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>, a partial front perspective view of the moving target device <b>10</b> in the non-shooting position <b>28</b> is depicted. The target <b>16</b> has been moved or pivoted to the non-shooting position <b>28</b> by use of the pivot assembly <b>18</b> and other components which will be described further herein. In the non-shooting position <b>28</b>, the target <b>16</b> is not visible to a shooter. Once in the non-shooting position <b>28</b>, the shooter will cease shooting at the device <b>10</b>. The moving target device <b>10</b> is shown having the target mounting frame <b>14</b> having the target <b>16</b> positioned therein, the pivot assembly <b>18</b>, the guard <b>20</b>, the upper arm <b>22</b>, and the lower arm <b>46</b>. As has been previously described, the arms <b>22</b> and <b>46</b> are attached or connected to the post assembly <b>12</b> for easy removal of the device <b>10</b>.<br />(12) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a perspective rear view of the moving target device <b>10</b> with the target <b>16</b> being in the shooting position <b>26</b>. The upper arm <b>22</b> may consist of an L-shaped arm or angle iron <b>48</b> having an upper leg <b>50</b> and a lower leg <b>52</b>. A first end <b>54</b> of the arm <b>22</b> may be attached or connected to the post assembly <b>12</b> by use of any suitable connector such as screws or bolts, neither of which are shown. It is also possible that other connecting devices may be used to attach or secure the arm <b>22</b> to the post assembly <b>12</b>. By way of example only, clamps, adhesives, hook and loop fasteners, cables, and straps may be used as suitable connecting devices. A second end <b>56</b> of the arm <b>22</b> may have an aperture <b>58</b> through which a pivot pin <b>60</b> is inserted. The pivot assembly <b>18</b> includes the pivot pin <b>60</b>, a central spindle or pivot arm <b>62</b>, and a lower pivot pin <b>64</b>. The pivot arm <b>62</b> may consist of an L-shaped arm or angle iron <b>66</b> having a first leg <b>68</b> and a second leg <b>70</b>. The arm <b>62</b> has a top end or bracket <b>72</b> having an aperture <b>74</b> formed therein for receiving and capturing the pivot pin <b>60</b>. The arm <b>62</b> also has a bottom end or bracket <b>76</b> having an aperture <b>78</b> formed therein for receiving and capturing the lower pivot pin <b>64</b>. Although not shown, the second leg <b>70</b> of the pivot arm <b>62</b> may have a few apertures to facilitate connecting or attaching the target mounting frame <b>14</b> to the arm <b>62</b>.<br />(13) The lower support arm <b>46</b> may also be formed of an L-shaped arm or angle iron <b>80</b> having an upper leg <b>82</b> and a lower leg <b>84</b>. A first end <b>86</b> of the arm <b>46</b> may be attached or connected to the post assembly <b>12</b> by use of any suitable connectors <b>88</b> inserted through apertures (not shown) formed in the lower leg <b>84</b>. Examples of suitable connectors <b>88</b> are screws, nails, or bolts. A second end <b>90</b> of the arm <b>46</b> may have an aperture (not shown) formed therein for receiving the lower pivot pin <b>64</b>. The pivot pin <b>64</b> may be a threaded pin and various components, such as washers and nuts, may be used to hold the pivot pin <b>64</b> in place while still allowing the pivot pin <b>64</b> to rotate.<br />(14) The pivot assembly <b>18</b> may be moved between the shooting position <b>26</b> and the non-shooting position <b>28</b> by use of a rotating metal disk <b>92</b> connected to a motor <b>94</b>, an electric magnet <b>96</b> connected to a magnet support assembly <b>98</b> which is connected to the arm <b>66</b>, and a return spring <b>100</b> connected to the magnet support assembly <b>98</b> and the upper leg <b>82</b>. The motor <b>94</b> is used to continuously rotate the disk <b>92</b>. The electric magnet <b>96</b>, when energized, will be attracted to the rotating metal disk <b>92</b> and will move the pivot assembly <b>18</b> from the non-shooting position <b>28</b> to the shooting position <b>26</b>. The electric magnet <b>96</b> is not strong enough to stop rotation of the disk <b>92</b>. However, it is possible that the speed of the disk <b>92</b> may decrease when the electric magnet <b>96</b> is energized. When the electric magnet <b>96</b> is de-energized the spring <b>100</b> will return the pivot assembly <b>18</b> to the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. The pivot assembly <b>18</b> is only capable of rotating in a 90° arc or angle due to the stop plate <b>24</b> preventing further rotation of the pivot assembly <b>18</b>. In particular, the stop plate <b>24</b> will contact the second leg <b>70</b> of the arm <b>66</b> to stop any rotation of the pivot assembly <b>18</b> past the stop plate <b>24</b>. As indicated above, if the guard <b>20</b> and the stop plate <b>24</b> are of unitary construction, then the guard <b>20</b> may also act as an obstruction to stop movement of the pivot assembly <b>18</b> past a certain point. The motor <b>94</b> may be an electric motor such as a 12 volt direct current motor. Although not shown, it is to be understood that the motor <b>94</b> is connected to a source of energy via any suitable conduit or wires. It is also possible that the motor <b>94</b> may be connected to a battery or a solar cell. The electric magnet <b>96</b> may be connected to a switch for selectively operating the magnet <b>96</b>, although such switch and connection are not shown. It is further possible that the switch may be a remote control switch, a foot switch or pedal, or even a computer operated switch that can be programmed to operate the device <b>10</b> in a random or predetermined manner or pattern. For example, the computer may be a smart phone having an application that can control a remote switch associated with the device <b>10</b> by Bluetooth® or other wireless technology or connectivity.<br />(15) The target mounting frame <b>14</b> also has a right side rear arm <b>102</b>, a bottom rear arm <b>104</b>, and a left side rear arm (not shown) that is used to capture the target <b>16</b>. The left side arm <b>30</b>, the retaining tab <b>32</b>, the bottom arm <b>34</b>, the right side arm <b>36</b>, the retaining tab <b>38</b>, the right side rear arm <b>102</b>, the bottom rear arm <b>104</b>, and the left side rear arm formed a channel in which the target <b>16</b> is placed and held. In this manner, the target mounting frame <b>14</b> may be used to easily and quickly removed a used target to insert a new target.<br />(16) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref> shows the moving target device <b>10</b> connected to the post assembly <b>12</b> with the target <b>16</b> being in the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. In this particular view, the electric magnet <b>96</b> has not been energized and is thus not attracted to the rotating metal disk <b>92</b>. There is also no tension on the spring <b>100</b> and no rotation or movement of the pivot assembly <b>18</b>. The motor <b>94</b> may be positioned in a motor housing assembly <b>102</b> that may be connected to the guard <b>20</b> and the lower support arm <b>46</b>. The motor <b>94</b> has a spindle <b>105</b> that passes through the assembly <b>102</b> and is connected to the disk <b>92</b> to spin or rotate the disk <b>92</b>. The electric magnet <b>96</b> is positioned above the disk <b>92</b>. The right side arm <b>36</b> is also shown holding the target <b>16</b> in position. The moving target device <b>10</b> is ready to be repositioned from the non-shooting position <b>28</b> to the shooting position <b>26</b> upon energizing the electric magnet <b>96</b>.<br />(17) With reference now to <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>, the moving target device <b>10</b> is shown in the shooting position <b>26</b>. The magnet support assembly <b>98</b> has a horizontal arm <b>106</b> that is connected to a vertical arm <b>108</b> and the first leg <b>68</b> and the second leg <b>70</b> of the pivot arm <b>62</b>. The electric magnet <b>96</b> is connected to the vertical arm <b>108</b>, which is best shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>. The arms <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> form the magnet support assembly <b>98</b>. The horizontal arm <b>106</b> has a spring retaining clip <b>110</b> that is used to retain a first end <b>112</b> of the spring <b>100</b>. The upper leg <b>82</b> of the lower support arm <b>46</b> also has a spring retaining clip <b>114</b> for retaining a second end <b>116</b> of the spring <b>100</b>. The spring <b>100</b> is held in place by use of the clips <b>110</b> and <b>114</b>. As can be appreciated, when the spring <b>100</b> is extended or under tension, as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>, the spring <b>100</b> will be able to quickly return the magnet support assembly <b>98</b> to the non-shooting position <b>28</b> when the electric magnet <b>96</b> is de-energized. As has been previously described, the rotating metal disc <b>92</b> is capable of continuously rotating even when the electric magnet <b>96</b> is energized. The device <b>10</b> also has a support arm <b>118</b> that connects the guard <b>20</b> to the lower leg <b>84</b>. The guard <b>20</b> is used to protect the disc <b>92</b>, motor <b>94</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref>), the electric magnet <b>96</b>, the magnet support assembly <b>98</b>, and the spring <b>100</b> from any bullet that may hit the guard <b>20</b>.<br />(18) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the moving target device <b>10</b> being in the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. The spring <b>100</b> has moved, pulled, or returned the magnet support assembly <b>98</b> to the non-shooting position <b>28</b> due to tension in the spring <b>100</b> being released by de-energizing the electric magnet <b>96</b>. The pivot arm <b>62</b> has moved 90° as compared to the position of the pivot arm <b>62</b> shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref>. This movement is due to the spring <b>100</b> pulling the pivot arm <b>62</b> back into the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. The electric magnet <b>96</b> has been de-energized and is not attracted to the rotating metal disk <b>92</b>. The disk <b>92</b> is free to rotate when the electric magnet <b>96</b> is de-energized. Once the electric magnet <b>96</b> is energized, the magnet <b>96</b> will be attracted to the disk <b>92</b> to travel with the disk <b>92</b> until the stop plate <b>24</b> is encountered.<br />(19) The moving target device <b>10</b> may operate in the following manner. The moving target device <b>10</b> is connected to the post assembly <b>12</b> in a safe place for shooting. The device <b>10</b> is connected to a power source to be able to operate the motor <b>94</b> and the electric magnet <b>96</b>. As has been discussed, the power source may be a battery if the device <b>10</b> is positioned in a remote location far from utility lines. Once connected, the target <b>16</b> is positioned within the target mounting frame <b>14</b>. Initially, the target <b>16</b> is in the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. The motor <b>94</b> begins spinning the disk <b>92</b> and a switch may be operated to energize the electric magnet <b>96</b>. Once the electric magnet <b>96</b> is energized, the magnet <b>96</b> will be magnetically attracted to the rotating disk <b>92</b>. This attraction will move the magnet support assembly <b>98</b>, the pivot assembly <b>18</b>, the target mounting frame <b>14</b>, and the target <b>16</b> into the shooting position <b>26</b>. Movement of these components <b>98</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b>, will also stretch out the spring <b>100</b>. These components <b>98</b>, <b>18</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>16</b> will continue moving until the second leg <b>70</b> of the pivot arm <b>62</b> impacts or contacts the stop plate <b>24</b>, the guard <b>20</b>, or both. The electric magnet <b>96</b> will still be attracted to the rotating disk <b>92</b> to keep the target <b>16</b> in place. Otherwise, the spring <b>100</b> would pull the target <b>16</b> back to the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. At this point, the device <b>10</b> presents the target <b>16</b> in the shooting position <b>26</b> and a shooter may attempt to hit the target <b>16</b>. At some point the electric magnet <b>96</b> is de-energized and once de-energized the electric magnet <b>96</b> is no longer attracted to the spinning disk <b>92</b>. The spring <b>100</b> will move the pivot arm <b>18</b> back to the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. Movement of the pivot arm <b>18</b> also causes rotation or movement of the target mounting frame <b>14</b> and the target <b>16</b> to the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. The magnet arm assembly <b>98</b> is also repositioned to the non-shooting position <b>28</b>. The moving target device <b>10</b> is now ready for presentation of the target <b>16</b> into the shooting position <b>26</b> upon energizing the electric magnet <b>96</b>. It is also possible that the target <b>16</b> may now be replaced with a new target <b>16</b>. For example, a first shooter may shoot at one target <b>16</b> and a second shooter may shoot at a second target <b>16</b>. Once the targets <b>16</b> are removed from the target mounting frame <b>14</b>, the targets <b>16</b> may be scored.<br />(20) As can be appreciated, various different shapes and sizes of targets <b>16</b> may be placed into the target mounting frame <b>14</b>. It is also possible that numerous moving target devices <b>10</b> may be set up for training purposes at a shooting range. For example, a first moving target device <b>10</b> may present the target <b>16</b> in the shooting position <b>26</b> for a first time interval and a second moving target device <b>10</b> may present the target <b>16</b> in the shooting position <b>26</b> for a second longer time interval. Further, by using springs <b>100</b> having different tensions, it is possible that a partial shooting position <b>26</b> may be presented to a shooter. In this particular arrangement, the electric magnet <b>96</b> may only be able to move the pivot assembly <b>18</b> less than 90° and only a portion of the target <b>16</b> is visible to a shooter. The device <b>10</b> may be controlled by a person shooting at the target <b>16</b> or by another person, such as an instructor. If an instructor is controlling operation of the device <b>10</b>, then the instructor can control when and for how long the target <b>16</b> will be presented or visible in the shooting position <b>26</b>. As has been indicated above, it is also possible that the device <b>10</b> may be under computer control and the target <b>16</b> may be presented in the shooting position <b>26</b> at various timed intervals such as random time intervals.<br />(21) The moving target device <b>10</b> may be constructed of any suitable material such as thick steel or steel plate. By way of example only, the steel may have a thickness of 13 mm. Some examples of the sizes of the various components of the device <b>10</b> are that the disc <b>92</b> may have a diameter of 250 mm, the upper support arm <b>22</b> and the lower support arm <b>46</b> may have a length of 250 mm, the pivot arm <b>62</b> may have a length of 720 mm, and the guard <b>20</b> may be 400 mm by 200 mm. However, these are examples only and other dimensions are possible and contemplated.<br />(22) From all that has been said, it will be clear that there has thus been shown and described herein a moving target device which fulfills the various objects and advantages sought therefor. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art, however, that many changes, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications of the subject moving target device are possible and contemplated. All changes, modifications, variations, and other uses and applications which do not depart from the spirit and scope of the disclosure are deemed to be covered by the disclosure, which is limited only by the claims which follow."

Radially inwardly from the shoulder 16 the inner portion of circumferential wall 11 extends longitudinally inwardly of the composite weapon as shown in FIG. 2, forming a cylindrical flange 17. Flange 17 on its outer cylindrical surfaces has a pair of longitudinally spaced grooves 18a, 18b. Elastomeric O-rings 19a, 19b are received within respective ones of the grooves. On its end face the flange 17 has a chamfered outer circumferential corner 14.<br />(4) The second member 20 has a relatively thin circumferential wall 21. Wall 21 provides the cylindrical outer surface B and also has a cylindrical inner surface 25. At its outer end the member 20 has an end wall 22 whose outer surface provides the dome-shaped end C2, while its inner surface 23 is cut in a shallow conical configuration.<br />(5) When the two rod parts 10 and 20 are longitudinally fitted together, the chamfer 14 of flange 17 provides a reliable centering action for inserting the flange within the end opening of member 20. The elastomeric O-rings 19a, 19b then form a relatively tight but nonetheless easily slidable seal with the inner cylindrical surface 25 of the member 20.<br />(6) Flexible member F is preferably a metal chain as illustrated. The respective end links of the chain are designated as 31 and 32. A pin P1 (FIG. 3) passes transversely through the outer end of member 10 and captures the corresponding end link 31 of the chain F. In similar fashion a pin P2 (FIG. 2) passes transversely through the outer end of member 20 and captures the corresponding end link 32 of the chain.<br />(7) ALTERNATE FORMS<br />(8) For purpose of use as a real weapon it is preferred to make both of the rod sections of metal, as illustrated in the drawing. Any desired type of metal may be used. The flexible member F may be a rope or cord or a wire, but for purpose of a real weapon is preferably a metal chain as illustrated.<br />(9) While the end walls 12 and 22 are presently illustrated as being fully enclosed, it may be preferred to form an opening in at least one of these end walls in order to permit the more rapid ingress and egress of air, which facilitates the longitudinal sliding action of the two rod portions when the weapon is to be extended, as well as facilitating the subsequent reassembly of the rod parts.<br />(10) When the invention is to be used as a toy, it is preferred to make the two rod parts from a plastic material, and the flexible member F may then be a string or cord or very lightweight chain. When the rod parts are made of plastic the use of the O-rings 19a, 19b is not necessary.<br />(11) As presently illustrated the parting line L is asymmetric; however, it may if desired be located in the precise longitudinal center of the device.<br />(12) The fasteners P1 and P2 are presently illustrated as dowel pins. Rivets or other types of fasteners may be used if desired. While the pins P1 and P2 are shown as extending transverse to the hollow rod portions, other types and arrangements of fastening devices may also be used so long as the respective ends of the flexible member are secured within the outer ends of the rod.<br />(13) In its presently preferred form the rod R is approximately 17/8 inches in diameter and has a length of approximately 83/4 inches between the points of the dome-shaped caps C1, C2. The preferred length of the chain F is 28 inches. However, other dimensions may be used as desired.<br />(14) The invention has been described in considerable detail in order to comply with the patent laws by providing a full public disclosure of at least one of its forms. However, such detailed description is not intended in any way to limit the broad features or principles of the invention, or the scope of patent monopoly to be granted."

The module is adapted for use with pop-up targets configured for remote or local activation. The module may be bullet-resistant and designed for deployment in harsh outdoor terrain. A system or method according to the invention automatically deploys targets responsive to triggering signals and automatically conceals targets responsive to hit detection signals. The system may employ centralized or decentralized target control, and can be scaled for controlling any number of targets deployed in a firing range or any other location.<br />(13) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 1</figref> shows a rear perspective view of one embodiment of a control module <b>10</b> for an autonomous target system according to the present invention. The rear view is provided to better illustrate control features and electrical connections. The chassis of control module <b>10</b> comprises an enclosure that houses electrical components of the module and provides external ports for these components on the rear panel <b>11</b>. Their location on the rear panel <b>11</b> protect the ports and connecting cables from frontal fire. The chassis outer surface further consists of front panel <b>13</b>, right side panel <b>15</b>, left side panel <b>17</b>, top panel <b>19</b>, and bottom panel <b>21</b>. The chassis provides mounting locations for the various components of control module <b>10</b>, including side shields <b>23</b>, target arms <b>24</b>, delay timer <b>28</b>, exposure timer <b>32</b>, external power port <b>35</b>, main connector <b>37</b> and link connector <b>39</b>. Rubber feet <b>22</b> are installed near each corner of bottom panel <b>21</b> for stability and shock absorption. A rear handle <b>41</b> is also mounted to the rear panel <b>11</b> to allow the control module to be easily ported by hand.<br />(14) The chassis is preferably constructed from bullet-resistant material, such as AR450 plate steel. In one embodiment, the panels of the chassis of control module <b>10</b> have a uniform thickness of ¼ inch for all panels—front, rear, top, bottom and sides. In another embodiment, the front panel <b>13</b> may have a thickness greater than the other panels, such as ⅜ inches or greater, to enable the module to withstand a direct hit from large caliber firearms such as a 30 caliber rifle or 9 mm handgun. In other embodiments that are designed for lighter duty, for example, air-soft applications, the chassis of control module <b>10</b> may be constructed from softer material, such as aluminum, hard plastic, or a lower grade of carbon steel.<br />(15) In addition to housing the electrical components, the chassis of control module <b>10</b> is configured with a safety feature for deflecting an errant shot, or near miss, into the ground. This feature is provided by disposing the front panel <b>13</b> at an angle alpha of approximately 120 degrees with respect to the bottom panel <b>21</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref>). The chassis also provides one or more protective shields <b>23</b>, which may each be disposed at a similar angle. Each shield <b>23</b> may comprise a generally rectangular plate, preferably composed of the same material as the chassis. Each shield <b>23</b> may be attached (e.g. by welding) to a side wall <b>19</b> forward of the target arm <b>24</b>, as shown. Each of the target arms <b>24</b> is configured to rotate about a shaft <b>25</b> that is coupled to an electric motor <b>45</b> housed within the chassis enclosure. Each target arm <b>24</b> comprises a hollow shaft <b>26</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref>) configured for engaging and supporting the support rods <b>47</b> of a target <b>49</b> (<figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref>).<br />(16) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 2</figref> shows a frontal view of the control module <b>10</b>. Only the protectively angled front panel <b>13</b> and the protectively angled shields <b>23</b> are visible in this view. Thus, an errant shot striking the control module from a shooter who is facing the target will likely impact one of these angled surfaces and be harmlessly deflected into the ground. In one embodiment of the invention, the control module <b>10</b> may include an optional near-miss detector <b>43</b> that can be mounted to the inside of the front panel <b>13</b>, as indicated by the phantom lines. Near-miss detector <b>43</b> may comprise a shock sensor, a vibration sensor, an accelerometer, or other instrument capable of outputting a reset signal to the control system described herein, in response to a bullet striking the chassis, the earth, or another obstruction in the near vicinity of the chassis. Near-miss detector <b>43</b> may be mounted in any convenient location inside the chassis or on its outer surface. In one embodiment, the near-miss detector <b>43</b> is placed on the ground some distance from the chassis, or can be wholly or partially buried under the earth, and coupled to the control module via cabling.<br />(17) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 3</figref> shows a right side view of the control module <b>10</b>. This view illustrates a protective shield <b>23</b> and target arm <b>24</b> mounted to the right panel <b>15</b> of the control module chassis. Target arm <b>24</b> is shown in a raised position, in which the target <b>49</b> is revealed to a shooter. Shield <b>23</b> is mounted forward of the target arm, and disposed at an angle similar to the angle alpha between the panel front panel <b>13</b> and the lower panel <b>21</b>. The shield <b>23</b> should be sized appropriately so that after mounting, its length is sufficient to protect any part of the target arm <b>24</b> from a frontal shot to the chassis. While the exact placement of each of the shield <b>23</b> and target arm <b>24</b> may vary along the length of the side panel <b>15</b>, a generally centralized location is preferred, as shown. Such a location allows the electric motor <b>45</b> which drives the shaft <b>25</b> to be centrally located within the chassis enclosure, and this tends to concentrate the center of mass at the control module center. Such an arrangement better stabilizes the control module for placement in uneven terrain, and in the event of impact from an errant shot.<br />(18) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref> is a left side view of the control module <b>10</b>. This view illustrates a second protective shield <b>23</b>, which in this case is mounted to the left panel <b>17</b> of the control module chassis, to protect a second target arm <b>24</b>. In some embodiments, only one target arm is used to reveal and conceal a target <b>49</b>, in which case the target arm and protective shield can be mounted either on the right panel <b>15</b> or the left panel <b>17</b>. For purposes of illustration only, <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 4</figref> shows the second target arm <b>24</b> in a lowered position, in which position the attached target <b>49</b> is concealed from a shooter. The configuration and operation of the second shield <b>23</b> and second target arm <b>24</b> are otherwise the same as described for similar components on the opposite panel. When opposing target arms <b>24</b> are installed at both the right and left panels, they work cooperatively in tandem to raise and lower the target.<br />(19) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 5</figref> and <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 6</figref> are top and bottom views, respectively, of the control module <b>10</b>. The top view shows the hollow shaft <b>26</b> formed into the top of each target arm <b>24</b>. Though shown in generally rectangular form, the cross-sectional shape of the hollow shaft <b>26</b> may be circular or hexagonal or any other configuration suitable for reliably engaging and holding support rods <b>47</b> in place throughout the target's span of rotation from the engaged to the concealed position and back again. In some embodiments, fastening hardware such as clevis and cotter pins (not shown) may be used to fasten support rods <b>47</b> within the hollow shafts <b>26</b>. In other embodiments, the components are configured to allow a friction fit to hold the support rods firmly in place. The top and bottom views also illustrate the protective geometry of the chassis. Each protective shield <b>23</b> has sufficient width to guard a target arm <b>24</b> against errant shots coming from a direction forward of the control module. Front panel <b>13</b>, due to its downward sloping angle, is visible only from the bottom view.<br />(20) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 7</figref> shows a rear view of the control module <b>10</b>. Notable in this view is the presence of an optional wireless switch <b>40</b>, which is plugged in to the main connector <b>37</b>, hiding it from view. Wireless switch <b>40</b> enables the control module <b>10</b> to communicate wirelessly with a remote control or with other control modules. Preferably, the remote control is capable of communicating at a distance of up to 1000 yards with at least eight wireless switches <b>40</b> to allow a remote operator to simulate ambush training. In one embodiment, wireless switch <b>40</b> comprises a model KL-K103X receiver and the remote control comprises a model KL3000-8 433 MHz transmitter, both made by Shenzhen Kelvin Electronics Co.<br />(21) According to the invention, multiple control modules <b>10</b> each equipped with a wireless switch <b>40</b> may form a cooperative system of targets deployed in a combat simulation course, wherein the wireless switches <b>40</b> allow any control receiving a trigger signal to relay (or transmit) the trigger signal to one or more other control modules in the system. The same functionality can be achieved using wired connections to the main connector <b>37</b>; however, the wireless option may be preferable in difficult terrain, or simply to avoid the inconvenience of handling and setting up cable in the field. Whether effected wirelessly or otherwise, the capability to link control modules in this manner facilitates the design or modification of a customized training course in which multiple control modules can cooperate without centralized control.<br />(22) The delay timer <b>28</b> may include an exposure delay adjustor <b>27</b> and an exposure delay display <b>29</b>. The exposure delay adjustor <b>27</b> provides manual means for selecting or adjusting a delay time for the target <b>49</b>. The delay time determines a time delay from receipt of a trigger signal by the control module to movement of the target <b>49</b> from a concealed position to a revealed position. The exposure delay display <b>29</b> provides a visual readout of time remaining until the delay times out.<br />(23) The exposure timer <b>32</b> may include an exposure duration adjustor <b>31</b> and an exposure duration display <b>33</b>. The exposure duration adjustor <b>31</b> provides manual means for selecting or adjusting an exposure time for the target <b>49</b>. The exposure time determines the amount of time that the target will remain in the revealed position without being hit until being moved back into the concealed position. The exposure duration display <b>33</b> provides a visual readout of time remaining until the exposure times out.<br />(24) The delay timer <b>28</b> and exposure timer <b>32</b> can be the same make and model timer, or they may be of different construction. In one embodiment, the delay timer <b>28</b> and exposure timer <b>32</b> are Anly Electronics Co model ASY-3D timers with a 0 to 999 second range and 24 VDC operating voltage.<br />(25) External power port <b>35</b> provides a means for connecting a power cable to the control module <b>10</b>, either to charge an internal battery or to run the module directly from an external power source. In this exemplary disclosure, the control module <b>10</b> operates on 24 VDC, though other operating voltages, DC or AC, are possible within the scope of the invention. External power port <b>35</b> may be configured as a socket, for example, to receive a coaxial cable or other multi-conductor plug.<br />(26) Main connector <b>37</b> and link connector <b>39</b> each provide an external interface to allow the control module <b>10</b> to send and receive control signals, and to provide power to other external components. Connectors <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> are preferably both multi-pin connectors. Examples of the signals connected through connectors <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> include remote control signals for concealing or revealing a target, motion sensing or trigger signals that indicate the presence of a human body within a predetermined distance from a target, hit detection signals that indicate a bullet striking the target, near-miss signals that indicate a bullet striking the control module or an obstruction near the control module, reset signals commanding the target to be concealed, and power signals for providing power to external components such as lighting under certain conditions. In one embodiment, one or both of main connector <b>37</b> and link connector <b>39</b> are 15-pin VGA connectors, as depicted in the exemplary figures. Further operation of the components shown on rear panel <b>11</b> and the various control signals are described below in greater detail with reference to the exemplary control circuit <b>90</b>.<br />(27) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref> shows a perspective view of a firing range illustrating an exemplary deployment of control modules that form a target shooting system in outdoor terrain. Each of control modules <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, and <b>10</b><i>c </i>is equipped with a target <b>49</b> installed in its target arms. In addition, motion sensors <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>51</b><i>b</i>, and <b>51</b><i>c </i>are placed at strategic locations in the forward vicinity of the targets. Each motion sensor may be connected to one or more of the target control modules by a wireless link or by communication cable. In the exemplary system depicted here, motion sensor <b>51</b><i>a </i>is mounted to the top panel of control module <b>10</b><i>a</i>, and coupled to the main connector via cable <b>53</b>. Motion sensor <b>51</b><i>b </i>is located on ground and may communicate wirelessly with all three control modules. Motion sensor <b>51</b><i>c </i>is located elsewhere on the terrain and is coupled to control module <b>10</b><i>c </i>by cable <b>55</b>. Each of the motion sensors is oriented to detect motion of a human body along a path likely to be traversed by a shooter, and when such motion is detected, to transmit a trigger signal to one or more control modules. For example, motion sensor <b>51</b><i>c </i>may be located in front of control module <b>10</b><i>c</i>, as shown, and pointing forward to detect the presence of an approaching shooter. Alternatively, any of the motion sensors can be placed on trees, shrubs, rocks, and other structures and oriented to detect human motion approaching a target from any likely direction. A cable <b>57</b> installed between the link connectors <b>39</b> of control modules <b>10</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>c </i>enables communication between the two, for example, to allow one control module to alert the other whenever a trigger signal is received.<br />(28) Delay settings on a control module may be adjusted according to placement of the motion sensors. For example, if a motion sensor is placed 100 feet from a target and the course designer plans for the control module to autonomously reveal its target when a shooter approaching at about five feet per second is approximately 50 feet from the target, the exposure delay on delay timer <b>28</b> can be adjusted to 10 seconds. The control modules may also be equipped with an optional delaying relay <b>59</b> that delays transmission of a trigger signal received from a motion sensor when relaying that trigger signal to another control module. Using this feature, target exposures can be staggered among multiple control modules in the system, all in response to a single triggering event, as a shooter moves through the course. Skilled artisans will recognize the versatility provided by the autonomous control modules, which make it possible to customize a target shooting course to achieve a variety of triggering sequences among a plurality of targets when activated by decentralized, autonomous controllers.<br />(29) A motion sensor <b>51</b><i>a</i>, <b>51</b><i>b</i>, or <b>51</b><i>c </i>may be an optical sensor, a vibration sensor, an acoustic sensor, an infrared sensor, a mechanical trip device, or any other sensor capable of detecting the presence of a human body and transmitting a trigger signal in response. The trigger signal may be a voltage or current signal, a switch opening or closure, transmission of an analog pulse or digital code, etc. The motion sensors are preferably capable of discriminating a human body from other disturbances such as the movement of animals or the detonation of flash grenades. In one embodiment, the motion sensor comprises a passive infrared sensor (PIR) such as those made by Visonic® for use in burglar alarms and automatically activated lighting systems. These sensors can be tuned to detect infrared radiation emitted by a human body, and are not triggered by light, vibration, or acoustics. For such motion sensors, detonation on the firing course of a flash grenade alone averts a trigger signal, as the sensors are immune to the resulting flash and acoustic shock. To discriminate from background radiation, the motion sensor can be configured as a pair of PIR sensors arranged for differential detection.<br />(30) The target <b>49</b> is preferably made of lightweight, consumable material such as paper, cardboard, or soft plastic. Lightweight material is preferred so that it won't deflect shots dangerously back in the direction of a shooter, and because it places a lighter load on the motor <b>45</b>. Each target <b>49</b> may include an image of a human torso or silhouette, depicting either a threat or an innocent bystander. Each target <b>49</b> may also include a hit detection sensor <b>61</b>. The hit detection sensor senses a direct hit on target <b>49</b> through vibration or other means, and in response outputs a hit signal to the hit detection module <b>63</b>, for example, via connection to the main or link connector. The hit signal may be a voltage or current signal, a switch opening or closure, transmission of an analog pulse or digital code, etc. In one embodiment, hit detection sensor <b>61</b> comprises a piezoelectric accelerometer.<br />(31) In another embodiment, hit detection sensor <b>61</b> operates as an inductive proximity sensor using known principles for detecting the velocity of copper-jacketed bullets at speeds of around 900 m/s or higher. Such systems operate by detecting a timing difference in the interruption of magnetic flux caused by passage of the bullet through two separate coils displaced by a known distance. A hit detection sensor <b>61</b> according to the present invention, however, requires only a single coil or single pair of conductive wires configured to detect an interruption in a magnetic flux induced in the coil, or induced in one wire lying within the magnetic field of a current-carrying wire, due to nearby passage of a copper-jacketed bullet. The momentary interruption in magnetic flux may be detected as a voltage signal that represents a bullet striking the target. Such a hit detection sensor <b>61</b> may comprise two or more conductive wires physically displaced from one another in a parallel an orientation creating a gap between any two wires wide enough to pass a large caliber copper-jacketed bullet without impacting any of the wires. The hit detection sensor <b>61</b> may be placed onto the target at a location that would indicate a successful hit. In one embodiment, the hit detection sensor may comprise a sheet of plastic film with embedded wires, such as a flex circuit, including sensing circuitry or a means for coupling the wires to the necessary sensing or signal conditioning circuitry.<br />(32) Each target <b>49</b> may also optionally be equipped with one or more pressure-sensitive LEDs or LED arrays <b>65</b> configured to illuminate around the area where an incoming round strikes the target. For example, an LED array <b>65</b> may be placed at locations on the target <b>49</b> that would indicate a lethal hit if struck by a bullet. The LEDs may be provided in the form of a plastic film or flex circuit containing OLED arrays. Power for the LEDs may be provided from the battery <b>67</b> or from another source.<br />(33) Each control module <b>10</b><i>a</i>, <b>10</b><i>b</i>, and <b>10</b><i>c </i>is configured to interface with additional sensing features. For example, control module <b>10</b><i>a </i>may include one or more near-miss detectors <b>43</b> in the form of a shock sensor, a vibration sensor, an accelerometer, or other instrument configured to output a near-miss signal akin to other signals described herein in response to a bullet striking the chassis, the earth, or another obstruction in the near vicinity of the chassis. In the embodiment depicted herein, the near-miss detector <b>43</b> is mounted to an inside surface of the front panel <b>13</b>; however, it may be mounted elsewhere on the control module, on a target arm <b>24</b>, or on the ground nearby. A control module <b>10</b> equipped with optional near-miss detection includes a near-miss detection module <b>69</b>. The near-miss detection module <b>69</b> interfaces with the existing trigger and reset controls in the control module. When a near-miss signal is received, the near-miss detection module <b>69</b> in response causes a reset signal to conceal the target <b>49</b>. Then upon lapse of a predetermined time delay stored in the near-miss control module, the near-miss control module causes a trigger signal to reveal the target <b>49</b>. This action simulates the behavior of a human target who is spooked by a near miss or who suffers a non-lethal wound such as a glancing shot to the foot or leg. The target momentarily collapses or disappears from sight, then reappears as a threat.<br />(34) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram of one embodiment of an electrical control circuit <b>70</b> showing interconnections among components of an autonomous control module according to the present invention. Control circuit <b>70</b> shows the following components that are enclosed within or mounted to the chassis: power switch <b>16</b>, delay timer <b>28</b>, exposure timer <b>32</b>, power port <b>35</b>, motor <b>45</b>, motion sensor module <b>51</b>, optional delay relay <b>59</b>, hit detection module <b>63</b>, battery <b>67</b>, near-miss module <b>69</b>, latching relay <b>71</b>, motor control relay <b>72</b>, power resistor <b>73</b>, and motor limit switches <b>77</b> and <b>79</b>. For simplicity, main and link connectors <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> are modeled as a single bus having multiple nodes <b>101</b> through <b>106</b>. The motion sensor <b>51</b>, hit detection module <b>63</b>, and near-miss module are understood to receive detection signals from the field. The external connections are omitted for simplicity. Control signals <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b> transmitted by these components are modeled as dashed lines. Solid lines indicate power connections.<br />(35) Battery <b>67</b> is enclosed within the control module and provides all power required for the control module to operate autonomously. In a preferred embodiment, battery <b>67</b> comprises a 24 VDC battery bank rated for 6.8 amp-hours and configured for external charging via external power port <b>35</b>. Power port <b>35</b> may be a 5.5 mm radial plug having compatible power ratings. In one embodiment, battery <b>67</b> and power port <b>35</b> are configured to allow the battery to charge from a rollable solar charging panel coupled to power port <b>35</b>. Power switch <b>16</b> when closed turns on the control module <b>10</b> to place it in a ready condition. In a preferred embodiment, power switch <b>16</b> is wired in series with battery <b>67</b> such that neither operation of the control circuit <b>70</b> nor charging of battery <b>67</b> can occur unless the power switch <b>16</b> is closed. This may be accomplished using a DPST power switch, wired in the configuration shown.<br />(36) Latching relay <b>71</b> controls the triggering and reset operations for the target <b>49</b>. Motor control relay <b>72</b> controls the voltage polarity cross the terminals of motor <b>45</b>, to cause the motor to rotate in one direction to reveal the target, or in the opposite direction to conceal the target. In a preferred embodiment, motor <b>45</b> is a 24 VDC motor rated to deliver 221 inch-lbs. of torque, and under a target load to rotate through 90 degrees between about 1.0 and 1.1 seconds. Motor <b>45</b> is also equipped with limit switches <b>77</b> and <b>79</b> to limit rotation of the motor to a span of about 90 degrees. Relays <b>71</b> and <b>72</b> may of similar or different construction. In one embodiment, these relays are identical double pole, double throw (DPDT) relays, Songle model SMI-24VDC-SD-2C with form C contacts rated for 10 amps.<br />(37) In the ready condition, with relay <b>72</b> unenergized, the positive terminal of battery <b>67</b> connects to motor terminal <b>78</b> through NC contact <b>96</b> and C contact <b>98</b>. Thus, with motor terminal <b>76</b> grounded through C contact <b>97</b> and NC contact <b>95</b>, +24V appears across the motor from terminal <b>78</b> to terminal <b>76</b>. This polarity causes motor <b>45</b> to rotate target <b>49</b> about +90 degrees in the target-concealing direction, or if the target is already concealed, a diode in limit switch <b>79</b> disables current flow and the target will remain temporarily locked in the concealed position with +24V across the motor terminals.<br />(38) In the ready condition, control module <b>10</b> awaits a trigger signal <b>81</b> at node <b>102</b>. Trigger signal <b>81</b> is a signal that energizes relay <b>71</b> across terminals <b>85</b> and <b>86</b>. For example, the trigger signal <b>81</b> may be a +24V pulse provided by remote control, or by a sensor such as a motion sensor <b>51</b> or near-miss module <b>69</b>, transmitted directly or through a transducer coupled to node <b>102</b>. Relay <b>71</b> is configured as a latching relay by shorting terminal <b>85</b> to NO contact <b>91</b>, so that a voltage pulse at terminal <b>85</b> switches the NO contacts <b>91</b> and <b>92</b> closed and the NC contacts <b>87</b> and <b>88</b> open. Terminal <b>85</b> is now latched to +24V through NO contacts <b>91</b>, C contact <b>89</b>, resistor <b>73</b>, and NC contact <b>38</b> of the exposure timer <b>32</b>. The latching action maintains relay <b>71</b> in this condition until contact <b>89</b> is grounded or deenergized to reset the relay. Optional diode D<b>1</b> may be installed as shown for protecting circuits coupled to node <b>102</b> when terminal <b>85</b> is energized. Optional diode D<b>3</b> may be installed as shown to prevent a module coupled to node <b>103</b> from energizing the relay <b>71</b>. The ratings of resistor <b>73</b> are selected so that the voltage division from +24V is sufficient to pick up the coil of relay <b>71</b>, and so that if contact <b>89</b> is shorted to ground to effect reset action, the resistor will limit the current draw to prevent an overload condition or tripping a fuse or circuit breaker elsewhere in the circuit. In one embodiment, resistor <b>73</b> is a 50-ohm, 5 W power resistor.<br />(39) The energization of relay <b>71</b> at terminal <b>85</b> causes NO contact <b>92</b> to connect to +24V through C contact <b>90</b>, which also energizes coil <b>30</b> of the delay timer <b>28</b>. Delay timer <b>28</b> then begins to count down its pre-adjusted exposure delay time. When the delay time has lapsed, NO contact <b>36</b> closes, completing the circuit through delay timer <b>28</b>, which simultaneously energizes relay <b>72</b> at terminal <b>94</b> and the coil <b>34</b> of exposure timer <b>32</b>.<br />(40) When relay <b>72</b> is energized, the voltage polarity across motor terminals <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> is reversed. In this condition terminal <b>76</b> receives +24V through C contact <b>97</b> and NO contact <b>99</b>, while terminal <b>78</b> is grounded through C contact <b>98</b> and NO contact <b>100</b>. Motor <b>45</b> now rotates the target <b>49</b> approximately −90 degrees in the revealing direction until limit switch <b>77</b> trips to block current flow to the motor by means of a diode, temporarily locking target <b>49</b> in the revealed position with −24V across the motor terminals.<br />(41) When the coil <b>34</b> is energized, the exposure timer <b>32</b> then begins to count down its pre-adjusted exposure time duration. When the exposure duration time has lapsed, the NC contact <b>38</b> opens, removing power from C contact <b>89</b> and NO contact <b>91</b>, thereby deenergizing the coil of relay <b>71</b>. When relay <b>71</b> drops out, NO contact <b>91</b> opens to reset the relay. NO contact <b>92</b> also opens, and this disconnects from power from the coil <b>30</b> of delay timer <b>28</b>, restoring NO contact <b>36</b> to the open position, which deenergizes exposure timer <b>32</b> and relay <b>72</b>. NC contact <b>38</b> of exposure timer <b>72</b> returns to the closed position, but cannot pick up relay <b>71</b> because NO contact <b>91</b> is open. The coil of relay <b>72</b> drops out, reversing the state of its contacts, and reversing the voltage polarity at motor terminals <b>76</b> and <b>78</b> thereby driving the motor in the concealing direction to conceal the target <b>49</b> and stop when limit switch <b>79</b> trips. The circuit <b>70</b> is now reset to the ready condition.<br />(42) Suppression diode D<b>7</b> may be placed as shown between NC contact <b>38</b> of the exposure timer <b>32</b> and the +24V node at NO contact <b>36</b> of the delay timer <b>28</b>. Diode D<b>7</b> prevents transient voltages (e.g. back-emf) from causing undesirable circuit operation, such as relay oscillation, when relay coils de-energize.<br />(43) Hit detection module <b>63</b> awaits a hit signal from a hit detection sensor <b>61</b> that is mounted onto target <b>49</b>. The hit signal is typically a very low power signal originating from an accelerometer or magnetic induction device, therefore the hit detection module receives and processes the hit signal, as necessary, using known signal processing techniques such as filtration and amplification. The output of the hit detection module is modeled as signal <b>82</b> and indicated by a corresponding dashed line, which may represent a current, voltage, or switching signal interfacing with node <b>103</b>. According to the invention, transmission of a hit detection signal from the hit detection sensor <b>61</b> is not effected unless the hit detection module <b>63</b> places signal <b>82</b> at node <b>103</b>. For example, signal <b>82</b> may represent closure of a switch that grounds node <b>103</b>. In operation, when a target <b>49</b> is in a revealed position, a shooter has an opportunity to shoot the target before the exposure timer <b>32</b> times out. If the shooter successfully strikes the target, the hit detection module in response will ground node <b>103</b> to deenergize relay <b>71</b> and reset the target before the exposure time has lapsed.<br />(44) Hit detection module <b>63</b> receives power through node <b>106</b> and the C contact <b>97</b> of relay <b>72</b>. Thus, according to the invention, hit detection module <b>63</b> is energized only when relay <b>72</b> is energized to connect power to C contact <b>97</b> through NO contact <b>99</b>. Otherwise the hit detection module remains grounded through C contact <b>97</b> and NC contact <b>95</b>. Optional diode D<b>6</b> may be installed as shown for additional circuit protection when node <b>106</b> is grounded. The overall effect is that the hit detection sensor <b>61</b> can transmit a hit detection signal <b>82</b> responsive to a shot striking the target <b>49</b> only when the target is revealed. This prevents false positive hit detections that may occur, for example, if debris or wind or other sources of vibration agitate the hit detection sensor <b>61</b> while the target <b>49</b> is in a concealed position.<br />(45) In one embodiment, the hit detection module <b>63</b> includes or is coupled to a time delay relay (not shown) that locks out operation of the hit detection module until the target <b>49</b> physically stabilizes after being motored into the revealed position. This may be accomplished by placing the contacts of a fixed or adjustable time delay relay in series with the power feed to the hit detection module. For example, a time delay in the range of about 1 to 2 seconds should allow the target <b>49</b> to stabilize and prevent shock or vibration caused by movement of the target to set off a false positive hit detection signal.<br />(46) Near-miss module <b>69</b> processes signals received from a near-miss detector <b>43</b>. Near-miss module <b>69</b> may include amplification and filtration circuits similar to those resident in hit detection module <b>63</b>, for converting or transducing a near-miss signal into a reset signal <b>83</b> for compatibility with the ratings of the control circuit. In one embodiment, some or all parts of near-miss module <b>69</b>, hit detection module <b>63</b>, and motion sensor module <b>51</b> may be incorporated into a common circuit board. In another embodiment, near-miss module <b>69</b> may be connected to control circuit <b>70</b> in a manner similar to that of hit detection module <b>63</b> such that a near-miss detector <b>43</b> may only transmit a reset signal <b>83</b> when the target <b>49</b> is revealed.<br />(47) Near-miss module <b>69</b> includes a time delay circuit, e.g. a relay (not shown) having a near-miss delay that may be pre-set or adjustable similar in operation to timers <b>28</b> and <b>32</b>. In response to receiving a near-miss signal from a near-miss detector <b>43</b>, near-miss module <b>69</b> simultaneously transmits the reset signal <b>83</b> and starts counting down the near-miss delay. If preset, the near-miss delay may be set, for example, for a relatively short period of about 4 or 5 seconds. Reset signal <b>83</b> has the same effect as hit detection signal <b>82</b>, to reset relay <b>71</b> and cause the target <b>49</b> to rotate to the concealed position. When the near-miss delay times out, however, the near-miss module <b>69</b> places a trigger signal <b>84</b> at node <b>102</b>. Trigger signal <b>84</b> has the same effect as trigger signal <b>81</b>, to actuate relay <b>71</b> and reveal the target <b>49</b>. The overall effect of the near-miss feature is to simulate human behavior when an errant, inaccurate, or otherwise non-lethal shot strikes a human target or impacts nearby. In such a circumstance, a hostile human target may react by immediately dropping to the ground or ducking for cover, only to reveal himself a few seconds later to open fire at his assailant.<br />(48) Control circuit <b>70</b> may include several additional features that allow it to communicate with, provide power to, or control other components external to the control module. The first of these features is the optional delay relay <b>59</b> that is coupled between nodes <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. Delay relay <b>59</b> includes a time delay circuit, as in the near-miss module <b>69</b>, that may be pre-set or adjustable. In a system according to the invention incorporating multiple mutually communicative control modules <b>10</b>, such as shown in <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 8</figref>, one or more nodes <b>101</b> may be linked to one or more nodes <b>101</b> of other control modules in the system, or to a centralized remote control, through wired or wireless means. The purpose of the delay relay <b>59</b> is allow for a time delay to lapse before alerting the other control modules in response to control circuit <b>70</b> receiving a trigger signal at node <b>102</b>.<br />(49) There are two reasons that a designer may wish to incorporate such a delay. The first reason is to stagger the response times among multiple targets that are deployed along the shooting course. This allows the designer more freedom to simulate a combat scenario by revealing targets at different times as a shooter moves through the course, all in response to the shooter tripping a single motion detector. Using this feature, the designer may create complex patterns for target deployment, in which some targets are revealed simultaneously, while others appear after one or more serial delays, as in a domino effect.<br />(50) The second reason that a designer may wish to incorporate a delay in delay relay <b>59</b> is to provide the shooter with an opportunity to successfully strike a triggered target <b>49</b> before the delay relay <b>59</b> times out. Delay relay <b>59</b> may be powered from a node such as node <b>106</b> which is energized only when target <b>49</b> is revealed. In this case, a hit detection signal <b>82</b> will conceal the target <b>49</b> and prevent delay relay <b>59</b> from alerting other control modules even though a motion sensor associated with target <b>49</b> had been tripped. This action simulates a scenario wherein a hostile target, such as a sentry, can potentially signal for reinforcements to escalate the complexity of a fire fight unless that hostile target is quickly dispatched.<br />(51) Node <b>106</b>, which provides power only when target <b>49</b> is revealed, may be coupled to multiple pins of the multi-pin connectors <b>37</b> and <b>39</b> and may provide power to components in addition to delay relay <b>59</b>. An LED array <b>65</b> is an example of one such component.<br />(52) Another feature provided by control circuit <b>70</b> is a power source for ancillary components or accessories that is energized only when the target <b>49</b> is concealed. Node <b>104</b> is an example of one such power source, which may be coupled to one or more pins of the multi-pin connectors <b>37</b> and <b>39</b>. Node <b>104</b> may be used, for example, to provide power to motion sensor <b>51</b> so that it cannot trigger relay <b>71</b> unless the target <b>49</b> is concealed. Optional diode D<b>4</b> may be installed as shown for circuit protection or to prevent battery <b>41</b> when discharged from drawing a charging current through node <b>104</b>.<br />(53) Another additional feature provided by control circuit <b>70</b> is a power source for ancillary components or accessories that is always energized whenever power switch <b>16</b> is switched on. Node <b>105</b> is an example of one such power source, which may be coupled to one or more pins of the multi-pin connectors <b>37</b> and <b>39</b>. Node <b>105</b> may be used, for example, to provide power to a lighting system or component for illuminating a portion of the shooting course, or to an audio system or component for distracting the shooter with sound. Optional diode D<b>5</b> may be installed as shown for circuit protection or to prevent battery <b>41</b> when discharged from drawing a charging current through node <b>104</b>.<br />(54) <figref idref=""DRAWINGS"">FIG. 10</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating salient steps in a method <b>200</b> according to the invention for autonomous position control of a target deployed in a combat simulation course. The steps of method <b>200</b> may be executed from the point of view of the autonomous control module <b>10</b>, and may reflect steps consistent with the foregoing disclosure describing various operating features of the control module.<br />(55) The method begins at step <b>202</b>, which provides an adjustable exposure delay for a target. Providing the adjustable exposure delay means, for example, enabling a capability for selecting a timing setpoint which will determine a time lapse between the point in time when the control module receives a trigger signal to the point in time that the target is revealed to a shooter. The next step is step <b>204</b>. Step <b>204</b> provides an adjustable exposure duration for the target. Providing the adjustable exposure duration for the target means for example, enabling a capability for selecting a timing setpoint which will determine a time span between the point in time when the target is first revealed to a shooter and the point in time that the target will be concealed from the shooter in the absence of receipt of an intervening hit detection signal. In the next step <b>206</b>, the method receives a motion sensor signal of human body movement within a known distance from the target. This step of the method corresponds to the signal that is transmitted when a shooter traversing the course trips a motion sensor. Physical limitations of a motion sensing device, as well as placement of the motion sensing device, may establish the known distance from the target.<br />(56) The next step <b>208</b> reveals the target when the target exposure delay lapses responsive to receiving the trigger signal. In other words, this step causes the target to move from a concealed position to a revealed position after the motion sensor signal is received in the previous step, and then after the adjustable target exposure delay that was provided in step <b>202</b> times out. Then, in step <b>210</b>, the method enables, only when the target is revealed, a hit detection sensor to transmit a hit detection signal responsive to a shot striking the target. This step means that the hit detection sensor is operationally locked out from affecting any step of the method unless the hit detection sensor senses a hit to the target during a time duration between the execution of steps <b>208</b> and <b>212</b>. The final step <b>212</b> comprises concealing the target responsive to the earliest of receiving the hit detection signal or lapse of the target exposure duration after revealing the target. This step causes the target to move from the revealed position back to the concealed position either because the target is hit by the shooter or because the adjustable target exposure duration that was provided in step <b>204</b> times out.<br />(57) Exemplary embodiments of the invention have been disclosed in an illustrative style.
